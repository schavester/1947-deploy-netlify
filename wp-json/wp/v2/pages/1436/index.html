The original 1947project blog is <a href=\"http:\/\/1947project.blogspot.com\" target=\"_blank\">archived<\/a> on blogspot, and the tales from that blog are being integrated into the site you&#8217;re now visiting.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThis is the original mission statement for the 1947 blog: &quot;Los Angeles in 1947 was a social powderkeg. War-damaged returning soldiers were threatened by a new kind of independent female, who in turn found her freedoms disappearing as male workers returned to the factories. These conflicts worked themselves out in dark ways. The Black Dahlia is the most famous victim of 1947&#8217;s sex wars, but hardly the only one. The 1947project seeks to document this pivotal year in L.A., through period reporting and visits to the scenes as they are today.&quot;\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMarch 2006: 1947project <a href=\"http:\/\/1947project.hiddenhistoryblogs.local\" target=\"_blank\">moves to its own URL <\/a>and unveils a new year of research, 1907, and a new primary writer, Larry Harnisch, whose excellent stories in the comments section of the 1947 blog were one of the best things about the original site. While Kim and Nathan focus on their <a href=\"http:\/\/www.esotouric.com\" target=\"_blank\">Crime Bus<\/a> tours, Larry explores the forgotten Los Angeles of 100 years ago with a series of fascinating posts on architecture, crime, city planning, mental illness, law, marriage and many other aspects of daily life in 1907 L.A.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMarch 2007: The site makes a quantum leap to 1927.
