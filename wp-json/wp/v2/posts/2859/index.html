When Miss Short declined his offer of a trip to the East, he struck her head with the butt of a Marine combat knife. He then bissected the young lady in the back of a stolen car parked in the manufacturing district, dumping the remains in the notorious vacant lot at <a href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?q=39th%20and%20Norton%2C%20Los%20Angeles%20ca&#038;hl=en\">39th and Norton.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>From there, Bailey claimed, he drove to the home of acquaintance William E.

When reached by police, Hughes said he hadn&#8217;t seen Bailey in six months, had found no bloody clothing in his home, nor was one of his suits missing.
