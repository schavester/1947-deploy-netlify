Funk admitted that he had returned alone to Burton Street after he and his father went home to South Gate following a night of heavy drinking. He claimed to recall arguing with Lund, but to be uncertain over what. He knew he had hit her in the jaw, shoved her onto the bed, then wrapped an electrical cord from a nearby iron tight around her throat. He claims he drove her corpse to the river, then returned home to sleep.<\/p>\n<p>The next morning, Hardrock Funk asked his son for a ride to Mrs. Lund&#8217;s, where the lady&#8217;s absence received no special mention from Myron. They fed the chickens and left quickly. <\/p>\n<p>Investigations focused on tire tracks in the soft river mud, which led Sheriff&#8217;s deputies to the Funks&#8217; car. Myron was questioned at the Compton jail while his father sweated it out in Whittier. A search revealed human blood on the spare tire. <\/p>\n<p>Myron&#8217;s confession seems to exonerate his father, who claims he was too drunk that night to remember much of anything.<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>March 12, 1947Whittier Sheriff&#8217;s deputies have obtained a confession from shaggy-haired Myron Funk, 23, in the shocking slaying of Mae Lorena Lund, the 46-year-old ladyfriend of Funk&#8217;s father Frank (aka Hardrock).
