Western Ave. apartment, where police found him poring over a stack of Appleby&#8217;s personal papers.&nbsp; They later found more of her personal items, including her diamond jewelry, in McMillan&#8217;s possession.&nbsp; Police investigators later found two versions of Appleby&#8217;s will, one which left her estate to McMillan, and another which left it to a long-lost daughter, although her relatives claimed that she&#8217;d never had a child.&nbsp; Neither will was signed, and both were strongly suspected to be forgeries.<\/p>\n<p> The evidence against McMillan was circumstantial, but strong.&nbsp; The stolen papers and jewels, a blood-stained jacket, the forged will, and the fact that he was the last person to be seen with Appleby were enough to convince jurors of his guilt.&nbsp; McMillan was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison on February 24, 1928. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>December 26, 1927San Fernando, CA The body of an unidentified woman was discovered off of Mulholland St. (now called Foothill Blvd.) in San Fernando today.
