His lifetime average in 1939 was 202, and he averaged 231 when he set the all-time high score record for nine games in 1937. Reporting on his astonishing 855 series rolled at Pico Palace in October 1939 (the second highest score in forty years of A.B.C. record keeping), the Times dubbed him \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c5\u201cthe sensational Jewish kegler.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u009d<\/p>\n<p>The sensational Mr. Stein seems to have felt he was too good a bowler to be limited to a single prize package.
