Howard, who&#8217;d left the establishment the day before the infant&#8217;s body was discovered.&nbsp; Since then, things have gone from curious to curiouser.<\/p>\n<p>Police found a bundle of little Norman Howard&#8217;s sleepers stashed in a downtown department store shortly after the body was found.&nbsp; Captain of Detectives Bean said, &quot;The mother is probably wandering around in a deranged condition and I believe she will either attempt to take her life or will put in an appearance at some institution within a few hours.&quot;<\/p>\n<p>While they continued to search for Howard, police investigations uncovered some information about the missing mother and her recent activities.&nbsp; Winnie Howard, 35, and her husband, Frank, had purchased a chicken farm in Norco, but separated soon afterwards; Winnie left the farm when she could no longer make the payments.&nbsp; Since then, she&#8217;d been staying with her baby in hotels around Riverside and Corona, finally going to her twin sister Minnie&#8217;s home in Reseda.<\/p><\/div>\n<div align=\"left\">&nbsp;<\/div>\n<div align=\"left\">Minnie Fabbro said that Winnie had left a few days before the baby was killed, and that she&#8217;d experienced a psychic vision where she saw her sister&#8217;s body floating in the ocean the night before police came to question her.<\/p>\n<p>After days of searching, Winnie Howard was finally found on the evening of August 26, not in the ocean, but at a Sierra Madre campground.&nbsp; She&#8217;d registered there under a false name, but had never claimed her campsite.&nbsp; Instead, Winnie had spent the four days since the death of her son wandering the hills without food or water.&nbsp; She was taken into custody, and placed under psychiatric watch.&nbsp; Upon hearing of Howard&#8217;s plight, a group of philanthropic club women took pity on her, and retained Attorney Milton Golden to defend her.<\/p>\n<p>Today, homicide investigator Eddie King files an insanity complaint against Howard, and the District Attorney&#8217;s Office warned that if Howard was found sane, they would charge her with murder.&nbsp; Golden replied that, despite this, they would fight the insanity charge.&nbsp; He said, &quot;Mrs. Howard is not insane.&nbsp; She accidentally rolled over on the child in her sleep and caused its death.&nbsp; If the District Attorney&#8217;s office wants to file a murder complaint, we are ready to go to trial.&quot;<\/p>\n<p>As far as the <em>Los Angeles Times<\/em> shows, it never came to that.&nbsp; On September 6, Howard was declared sane and sent to a sanatorium for two weeks to complete her recovery.&nbsp; Afterwards, she was released into Minnie&#8217;s custody.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last week, we learned of a baby found dead in a Main Street flophouse, apparently strangled, with cotton stuffed in his nose and mouth.&nbsp; Police were looking for the woman who&#8217;d registered for the hotel room, a Mrs. W.
