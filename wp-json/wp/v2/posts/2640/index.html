Lately he\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s taken to running away. So he spends his days padlocked to the bed in the room he shares with five of his siblings, with occasional visits to the yard. He\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s only unlocked when his stepfather is home and can control him, and catch him if he runs.<\/p>\n<p>It must have been one of those chained stays in the yard that led to the visit from the juvenile division officers, who came to inquire and learned that Earl and his 6-foot length of chain had been intimate for the past five months. They\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2re working on arranging a formal committal to an institution, which will leave the Velasquez family free to concentrate on their other children.<\/p>\n<p>Edith expressed hope that Earl might fare better in his new home. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c5\u201cIt will be so much better for him there. He\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s never been to school, and maybe at the right place they can teach him something. Last year he\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2d try to get on the school bus with my other children. But the driver knew him and would always send him back home.
