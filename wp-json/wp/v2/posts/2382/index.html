For more than a year, the families had endured mutual accusations of destroyed fences, ripped up landscaping, tossed rocks and ill-aimed hoses.<\/p>\n<p>Then, under the pretense of making peace, La Goldberg asked La Kelly over to meet a prospective buyer for the Goldberg manse, and share a pot of tea&#8230; but as they walked together to 1921, according to La Kelly, La Goldberg grabbed her around the throat and chortled &#8220;I&#8217;ve been wanting to do this for a long time!&#8221; Soon the two women were rolling around in the flower bed. The residents of Garth Ave., by now used to such hijinx, gathered around to watch the fun.<\/p>\n<p>Then from the Goldberg house emerged a man dressed like a cowboy&#8211;actually R. G. Hampton, a private detective hired to stay in the home and observe such incidents&#8211;firing a gun and demanding the fighting stop or he&#8217;d shoot the combatants! Mrs. Goldberg was arrested for disturbing the peace, with Hampton charged for firing a gun within city limits.<\/p>\n<p>During court time soon after the incident, La Kelly acknowledged that she washed her sidewalk whenever La Goldberg passed over it, telling neighbors that this was a necessary chore whenever &#8220;that dirty rat&#8221; passed by. But she refused to admit to throwing rocks at the Goldberg house, and painted herself as the innocent victim. This tone continued in today&#8217;s court session, as she elaborated on the tale of assault, including the allegation that Goldberg&#8217;s husband David and 16-year-old daughter Norma assisted in the beating.<\/p>\n<p>Mrs. Goldberg is seeking $201,000 damages for malicious prosecution, while Mrs. Kelly considers her own damages worth a comparatively paltry $200,200.
