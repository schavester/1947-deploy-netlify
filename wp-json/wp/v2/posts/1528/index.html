She was a cousin to the deceased husband of Randall&#8217;s sister, Mrs. H.K. Pratt, who lives next door to her brother and their sister Mrs. Mabel Bennett. Out of consideration for that slim tie, McCormick and her son were recently welcomed into the Bennett-Randall manse when her habit of masquerading as a woman of means in order to secure fancy hotel lodgings for which she could not pay reached its inevitable conclusion.<\/p>\n<p>But after a few days residence, McCormick&#8217;s odd, oftimes abusive behavior became distressing to the siblings. They believed her to be insane, and while sympathetic, demanded that she find alternate lodgings. She responded with a threat upon Randall&#8217;s life, so he swore out a warrant for her arrest. The lady ran away ahead of the Sheriff, but returned to break a window, whereupon she was captured.<\/p>\n<p>Randall expressed concern for 15-year-old Merrill, a strong boy who ought to be working rather than following his mad mama from hotel to hotel, absorbing her weird fantasies and parroting them back at police officers. Randall offered to help the boy, but Merrill refused, insisting he would stay with friends and fight for his mother&#8217;s freedom and the vast fortune of which she was being deprived.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>May 14, 1907 Highland Park Yesterday&#8217;s claim by young&nbsp; Merrill &quot;William&quot; McCormick that his mother Janette had been falsely dragged off to the bughouse as part of an elaborate interfamilial inheritance scam has been roundly denied by Arthur Randall, real estate man and the owner of the home on Avenue 66 from which the lady&hellip; <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/1947project.hiddenhistoryblogs.local\/2006\/05\/15\/mad-mama-2\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Mad Mama!<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":8,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[2143,2122,1965,3789,2286,1911],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.0.2 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Mad Mama!
