just a few days since his release from the Whittier State School, a reformatory.&nbsp; The emotionally disturbed Wittenmeyer said that on his way home from the movies on May 28, he picked up an automobile spring leaf from a scrap heap, and &quot;got a funny notion to hit someone.&quot;&nbsp; He saw Weigel walking home from the confectionery story, laden with bundles, and struck her twice in the side of the head.&nbsp; And what was the offense that had previously landed Wittenmeyer in juvie?&nbsp; Throwing a rock at a woman&#8217;s head in 1924.<\/p>\n<p>Like a 1927 Veronica Mars, Thelma Sharp, the 17-year-old daughter of a Pomona police detective, helped police pin down the murderer.&nbsp; Working as an usher at the movie theater, she&#8217;d seen Wittenmeyer the night of the murder, and knew of his previous antics.&nbsp; When police followed up on her lead, they found Wittenmeyer&#8217;s distraught father in the midst of soul-searching.&nbsp; The man burst out, &quot;My boy killed that woman.&nbsp; I have been beside myself since yesterday afternoon when I made him confess to me&#8230; I took cleaning fluid and tried to clean the blood off his clothes yesterday afternoon.&quot;<br \/><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"187\" height=\"425\" border=\"0\" align=\"right\" title=\"wittenmeyeronstand\" alt=\"wittenmeyeronstand\" src=\"\/\/farm1.static.flickr.com\/193\/520342750_0c73bc26e7_o.jpg\" \/><br \/>Without emotion, young Wittenmeyer confessed to the police.&nbsp; A judge declared Wittenmeyer an unfit subject for juvenile court, and he was set to stand trial as an adult.&nbsp; A psychiatric evaluation found the boy emotionally unstable, but sane.&nbsp; However, a team of alienists for the defense begged to differ.&nbsp; Wittenmeyer suffered from a hereditary form of psychosis, they said, and the boy&#8217;s father testified that his wife was known to have hallucinations and that once, she&#8217;d been found wandering naked in an orange grove.&nbsp; Supervisors of the reform schools where Wittenmeyer had previously been an inmate testified to his erratic behavior while in custody.&nbsp; Throughout the proceedings, the boy seemed oblivious, amusing himself by arranging blotters on a table.<\/p>\n<p>As the prosecution and defense rested, the jury was instructed to return one of four verdicts:&nbsp; not guilty, guilty of first degree murder, guilty of second degree murder, or guilty of first degree murder with the recommendation of a life sentence.&nbsp; Although deliberations were expected to be speedy, the jury was deadlocked after the first day with a single hold-out for a not guilty verdict, while the remaining 11 jurors stood in favor of the harshest sentence.<\/p>\n<p>After 33 hours, Judge Fletcher Bowron threatened to replace the jurors unless they returned a verdict by noon the next day.&nbsp; However, the jury&#8217;s vote now stood at 10-2, with another juror in favor of acquittal.&nbsp; The foreman emerged periodically to ask Bowron whether a recommendation for leniency would be granted, and what the sentence was for second-degree murder.&nbsp; Bowron refused to answer his questions, saying that ultimately, the boy&#8217;s sentence was none of their concern.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, after 55 hours of deliberation, the jury returned a verdict that found Wittenmeyer guilty of murder in the second degree, which carried a sentence of 5 years to life, making the boy eligible for parole in 1932.&nbsp; Acquittal would have sent Wittenmeyer to a state mental facility, so while he did not receive the treatment he needed, the jury&#8217;s decision at least spared the teenager from life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.&nbsp; Or did it?<\/p>\n<p>As of November 1949 (the last mention I could find of him), Wittenmeyer was still serving time in San Quentin, having been denied parole on at least four occasions.<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>May 30, 1927 Pomona&nbsp; &nbsp; Today, 16-year-old Durward Wittenmeyer confessed to the murder of Fannie
