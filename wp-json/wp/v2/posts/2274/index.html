Described by friends as a &#8220;genial gentleman&#8221; and an &#8220;exceptional conversationalist,&#8221; Burgert was also wealthy. Stinking rich, in fact; his estate was valued at $500,000 (almost $6 million in current money). A bachelor, Burgert dictated that all but $500 of his estate be put in a trust fund, the income from which would accrue to the benefit of the Kirkendall family of Omaha, Nebraska. <\/p>\n<p>This was all well and good, especially for the Kirkendalls, but Burgert was a man with a vision. His will stipulated that fifty years after the death of Bourdette Kirkendall, Jr. (two years of age in 1927), the remainder of the trust would be used to build &#8220;a home for girls between the ages of 16 and 28 years, of small stature (no fat girls need apply), bright, ambitious, stylish, and good to look at,&#8221; the Times explained. The newspaper speculated that it might be as long as 100 years before &#8220;The Burgert Apartments&#8221; (the will provided the building&#8217;s name) took shape. Whatever decade the ground was finally broken, no expense was to be spared; at least $50,000 was to be spent on the building&#8217;s construction in Toledo. <\/p>\n<p>The home would provide accommodation for between 30 and 40 girls, slim and &#8220;ambitious to live and to see brighter and better environments of life than what they are used to,&#8221; the will stipulated, &#8220;for young women who have to provide a living for themselves in the business world; who have natural ambitions to see things as their more fortunate sisters see them. <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Nature has given this type of young woman [the will continued] a love for beautiful things that unfortunately parents can not provide.&#8221; Perhaps with this last codicil in mind, Burgert attached a photograph of himself to the document and requested that it be reproduced as a painting to be hung where &#8220;I may look down on the good work that this will is intended to do&#8221; (and perhaps a pillow fight or two). <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;May the world be bright and happy for those girls as it has been for me,&#8221; the will concluded. One can only hope the &#8220;comely and ambitious&#8221; young women of sometime around 2027 appreciate their benefactor from the past, who clearly didn&#8217;t anticipate the advent of fat discrimination lawsuits.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Omaha, Nebraska February 26, 1927 (Exclusive) David Bourdette Burgert passed away in Toledo, Ohio last year.
