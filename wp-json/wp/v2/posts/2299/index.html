Dale Carleton, developer and proprietor of the spanking-new 1914 Armondale, is sued by wifey Marie for a sizable share of his $250,000 net worth.  Mrs. Carleton names a Ms. Helen Williams\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009dArmondale telephone girl whose duties apparently went above and beyond the working of switchboard\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009das correspondent. <\/p>\n<p>1919. Wilbert Garrison, 28, son of a wealthy publisher in New York, drove across country with a buddy and they holed up in the Armondale.  A week later Wilbert left in his room his money, valuables, and a note indicating that he did not want to be a burden on others, and as such was ending his life.  Despite the best efforts of the Nick Harris detective agency (who calls the cops in 1919?), Wilbert is never found.<\/p>\n<p>1930.

Washed-up boxer Louis Menney, 22, Armondale resident, is tackled by a priest after he sexually assaulted a 62 year-old woman in a church at 9th (now James M. Woods) and Green.

Francis Sylvester, of the Armondale, works across the street at the Western Union at 741 South Flower.  Sylvester wires untold sums in care of himself to small outlying towns, where there are no Western Union offices, and destroys the records of the transactions.<\/p>\n<p>And 1965.  Percy Hatch, 65, who had been in the hotel since 1957, started talking crazy-talk.  As in, a loggorhea of obscenities for two straight weeks.  Behind the  Armondale registration desk was manager Nancy Furlow, 62, who, finally fed up with her repeated warnings, reached for the phone, and was shot dead by Hatch with one bullet.  Hatch therewith turned the gun on himself.<\/p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter the Armondale was felled and a rather ill-advised Broadway was built on the site.  Now a Macy\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s, it resembles a <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Dawn<\/span> mall on a slow day.

They would read, or shack up and drink, and maybe he&#8217;d talk bowling and maybe she&#8217;d talk law, but probably not.
