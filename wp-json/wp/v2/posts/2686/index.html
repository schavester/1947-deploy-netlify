She turned up in a new red convertible, and motioned for them to follow her to Gianaclis&#8217; house up the hill. Near it, she used her car to block Gianaclis\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 car while pointing him out to three associates in a third vehicle, one of whom administered a blackjack beating while the others held guns. Gianaclis and Davis were forced into their assailants\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 car and driven for more than an hour, with blows punctuating every move they made. On arrival in Lopez Canyon, they were held at gunpoint for six hours, until they managed to escape and find aid at Slocum Ranch.<\/p>\n<p>What\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s it all about, Madgey? The lady recently made noise about suing her former manager for substituting a grant deed for a mortgage paper on the house at <a href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?q=8444+Magnolia+Drive,+Los+Angeles,+CA&#038;spn=0.018331,0.030822&#038;hl=en\">8444 Magnolia Drive<\/a> where until recently she and her family lived, and where the two hostages now reside, though after some initial testimony, the matter was dropped. Gianaclis identified one of his attackers as William Klinkenburg, 32-year-old cook, 6439 Agnes Street. When arrested, Klinkenburg was holding a gun belonging to Barclay Leon Thomas, 33, of 6936 Woody Trail. Barclay\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s three-year marriage to Gianaclis\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 daughter was annulled last week.

Miss Meredith turned herself in and served more than two years in prison at Tehachapi before her sentence was commuted by Governor Warren in 1951; Gianaclis had his citizenship denied for reasons of poor character; and in the end the lady got her house back, married a doctor (though it didn&#8217;t last) and apparently made some films in Europe.]<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>July 2, 1947Los Angeles Madge Meredith\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009dwhat went wrong?
