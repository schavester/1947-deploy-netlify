The project was such a success that they followed up with a similar blog detailing the sordid affairs of 1907 and 1927. Now, Cooper and others lead excursions for a tour bus company called Esotouric. The four- or five-hour adventures canvass the city, highlighting crime sites from the heinous to the quirky. This summer, Esotouric debuted &quot;John Fante&#8217;s Dreams of Bunker Hill,&quot; which visited the Downtown haunts of Arturo Bandini, the protagonist of Fante&#8217;s 1939 novel <em>Ask the Dust.<\/em> In August, don&#8217;t miss the Charles Bukowski birthday tour, which celebrates what would have been the author&#8217;s 87th birthday.

You can ride one for $25 or both for $45, and we hope the lower price and shorter running time will be an opportunity for folks who&#8217;ve been wanting to ride for a while to join us.
