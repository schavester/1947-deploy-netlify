Ruth had persuaded her husband to take out a double indemnity policy, which would pay&nbsp;her in the event of his accidental death. It was the lure of the $97,000 worth of life insurance that compelled her to continue with her diabolical schemes until she succeeded. <\/p>\n<p>Fueled by two bottles of whiskey and profound stupidity, the criminally-challenged duo staged the murder scene as a burglary gone horribly wrong. But their pathetic plan was doomed to failure. They threw an Italian language newspaper on the floor as a false clue to the identity of the killers. They emptied dresser drawers and overturned chairs. And in an act that would eventually help prosecutors to prove her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, Ruth hid her allegedly stolen jewelry under her mattress, about three feet away from Albert&rsquo;s battered body! <\/p>\n<p>The trial of Ruth and Judd would be a media circus, and celebrities such as director D.W. Griffith, and evangelists Billy Sunday and Aimee Semple McPherson would attend. Ruth would be called &ldquo;ruthless Ruth&rdquo;, &ldquo;vampire&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;blonde fiend&rdquo; by the press. Evidently not all men found those appellations a turn-off, because Ruth received at least 160 marriage proposals during her incarceration. <img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"DEAD\" height=\"312\" alt=\"DEAD\" src=\"\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2268\/2118797280_b48c64d100_o.jpg\" width=\"217\" align=\"right\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Ruth, her plea for clemency would be denied by Governor Al Smith. Her execution would be famously recorded by newspaper man Tom Howard. The ingenious reporter had strapped a miniature <a title=\"ankle camera\" href=\"http:\/\/americanhistory.si.edu\/collections\/object.cfm?key=35&#038;objkey=160\" target=\"_blank\">camera<\/a> to his ankle beneath his trousers. Just as the executioner threw the switch on the whimpering murderess, Tom raised the cuff of his pants and snapped the tabloid photo of a lifetime. <\/p>\n<p>The murderers were unexceptional, but their crime inspired art. <a title=\"Machinal\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Machinal\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;Machinal&rdquo;,<\/a> a play by Sophie Treadwell was deemed one of the best of 1928-29. <a title=\"James M Cain\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/James_M_Cain\" target=\"_blank\">James M.
