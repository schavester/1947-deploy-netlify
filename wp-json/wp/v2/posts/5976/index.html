If his complaints are mainly that signs exist that didn&#8217;t exist until the early 50&#8217;s, or that there were stairs rather than a road at a certain intersection, I feel pretty confident that they got the big stuff right.&nbsp;<\/em> <\/p>\n<p><a title=\"this\" href=\"\/web\/20160314090107\/http:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/ps3\/adventure\/lanoire\/show_msgs.php?topic_id=m-1-59080563&amp;pid=929170&amp;tag=topics%3Btitle\" target=\"_blank\">Which<\/a> is a fascinating statement.&nbsp; Naturally, I would counter with the dusty old Miesian idiom &#8220;God is in the details.&#8221;&nbsp; I mean, Rockstar&#8217;s consumed with the <em>Gesamkunstwerk<\/em> here, and you&#8217;re going to let the details <em>slide<\/em>?&nbsp; Hey, I warned y&#8217;all.&nbsp; I self-confessed to nitpickery in my own text.&nbsp; To continue:<\/p>\n<p><em>GotDAMN, I think they&#8217;re almost expecting too much out of the game with some of those nitpicks, and also don&#8217;t seem to have a firm grasp on the concept that videogames are still very much limited by the hardware. I will commend him on the amount of information in that article, but it&#8217;s a little overboard IMO. And with no mention of the face capturing tech + hiring all these actors to actually play their parts, someone should tell him that the huge budget he mentioned couldn&#8217;t all go towards recreating a perfect 1947 LA brick by brick.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>I got that he still enjoyed it, but I feel like maybe if he stated some of his complaints in front of the Rockstar reps, they could&#8217;ve or should&#8217;ve explained how they couldn&#8217;t afford to focus on recreating a 100% perfect city because they&#8217;re building a GAME, and not a 1947 LA simulator. While he does point out that he pushed the &#8220;game aspects&#8221; to the background for that article since that&#8217;s not where his areas of expertise lie, I think doing that does a disservice to just how much work the team has to do when making all this stuff.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>I&#8217;d like to hear his opinion of the game after he puts 20 hours into it, and whether or not he&#8217;s still looking at what&#8217;s NOT there instead of the whole picture.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>I see where you&#8217;re coming from, but he explicitly noted he had no idea about video games or the industry, and was really only brought in to sample the world, not the game.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>I think he was credited as a consultant too, so he probably invested considerable emotion regarding the ultimate recreation of LA.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I agree with everything <a title=\"LAgrasponAnything\" href=\"\/web\/20160314090107\/http:\/\/www.neogaf.com\/forum\/showthread.php?t=428479&amp;page=2\" target=\"_blank\">said above<\/a>:&nbsp;
