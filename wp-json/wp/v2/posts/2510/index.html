He wasn&#8217;t much trouble until his own divorce went through last August; ever since, he&#8217;s been pressing Gloria to be his wife. She made it clear she wasn&#8217;t interested, but continued to see Bob. It made a break from her theater usherette job and nights at home at 14215 S. Vermont with her parents and 3-year-old son Richard.<\/p>\n<p>Last night his frustrations reached the boiling point while he was driving her home from work after midnight.

The lady repeated no way, no how.<\/p>\n<p>Bob grabbed the ribbon tie around her neck and choked her, dragged her out of the car, letting her head connect with the running board. Desperate, Gloria scrambled to get underneath the vehicle and away from her tormentor. Then another couple pulled up to see what the trouble was. Bob made noises about a lover&#8217;s spat, but Gloria shrieked and ran for help. Her saviors were Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd Brownley of 334 Oxford St., and they brought her to the Vermont Ave. sheriff&#8217;s substation where she swore out a complaint.<\/p>\n<p>Bob Holstein, still being sought, lives at 1540 146th Street in Hawthorne.
