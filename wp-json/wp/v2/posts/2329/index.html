Two blocks from Pasadena&#8217;s busiest corner, Crown City Plating Co. electroplates chromium, gold, brass, silver, copper. A swart little man named Wallace Foreman was mixing sulphuric acid and glycerin to make an electrolyte for plating. Already in the tank were 75 gal. of acid and 2 gal. of glycerin. Thinking to add more acid, Wallace Foreman picked up a 3-gal. container, dumped in the contents. Unluckily the container held not sulphuric but nitric acid&#8230;.<br \/><\/span> <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">              <br \/>Time Magazine<\/span>, 27 August 1934<\/p>\n<p>I mean, you can mix sulphuric acid with glycerin all you want.
