With her was a little girl, around 4 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00bd years of age. Mrs. Crow explained that the room had been rented, but she agreed to care for and board the child for $15 a week.<\/p>\n<p>The blonde eagerly accepted the offer. She introduced herself as Toni, and explained that she and her daughter Sandy had just come from Seattle, that she was a cocktail waitress, separated from her husband, and that she had sold her house to finance an operation for the child, who was born blind but could now see. And if Mrs. Crow would just keep an eye on Sandy, she\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2d just go down to the post office and get some money\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6<\/p>\n<p>And of course that was the last Mrs. Crow saw of Sandy\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s mother.

She told reporters that she was broke and had no friends in Los Angeles, that Sandy was hungry, and she couldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2t stand to see the child suffer.<\/p>\n<p>She\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2d come to town looking for her estranged husband, a barman by the name of James (Slim) DuBose, in hopes that he would pony up some cash for Sandy\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s eye treatments\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009dastigmatism had made her blind from birth until an operation last fall.
