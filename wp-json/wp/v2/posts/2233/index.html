Each January 15, our friend and Dahlia-ologist Larry Harnisch likes to prune his roses and think of Beth. Richard already pruned our roses this morning, and as they come back to lovely life we will remember this little lost girl. She would have been 83 years old, had she lived.<\/p>\n<p>On Sunday, the Esotouric bus rolled south from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vromansbookstore.com\" target=\"_blank\">Vroman&#8217;s Bookstore<\/a> with a full bus of charming people for the debut of Richard&#8217;s new manifestation of our flagship tour THE REAL BLACK DAHLIA. We were seen off by the delightful Queen Mickie, taking a break from her Doodah Parade preparations to christen the bus with champagne&#8230; bubblebath! Then we headed downtown, to explore the psychology and deep mysteries of Beth Short&#8217;s last hours, visiting the places she frequented, examining the characters who touched her, in life and in death and coming to some understanding of who this strange girl was and what brought her to Los Angeles and her early death. <\/p>\n<p>See photos from this tour here:<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/blackdahliavromans1-13-08.notlong.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/blackdahliavromans1-13-08.notlong.com\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>And see Queen Mickie in the Doodah Parade next Sunday:<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pasadenadoodahparade.info\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.pasadenadoodahparade.info\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>This Saturday, 1\/19, we offer my personal favorite of our true crime tours, BLOOD AND DUMPLINGS, a criminal and gastronomical excursion into the deeply bizarre criminal and cultural history of the San Gabriel Valley.
