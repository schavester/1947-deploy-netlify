It&#8217;s easy if you know how, especially if it&#8217;s been broken as many times as mine has. Now about that money. See, I&#8217;ll get a ride in your taxi, and while we&#8217;re riding, I&#8217;ll yell and come up with the broken wrist. Your boss&#8217;ll pay me to go away! You do the talking, and I&#8217;ll do the yelling. I can make my face look green, too, if I concentrate. And what we make, I&#8217;ll split with you. I&#8217;ll take nothing less than $2500.

And while Rice would be convicted of this crime, the lady was acquitted, which gave Rice&#8217;s attorney the opportunity to appeal to the judge&mdash;how could a man conspire alone? It was a good point, and on May 9, our loose-limbed hero was turned loose to scam again.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>January 25, 1927Los Angeles &quot;Wanna make some easy money?
