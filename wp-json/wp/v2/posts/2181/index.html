While they were less than impressed with his display of husbandly solicitude, detectives were happy to take McLane into custody after he confessed to Ada May&#8217;s murder. Ever the helpful suspect, McLane then explained that, contrary to police speculation, the bloody pair of scissors found next to his wife&#8217;s body was not in fact the murder weapon:  he had used a Barlow knife, which he tossed into the night as he ran from the scene of the crime.   The couple had been separated for about five months, and McLane recently received divorce papers from his wife. This, he told detectives, inspired him to attempt a reconciliation&mdash;an attempt which led not to the revival of their marriage but to a quarrel that resulted in the death of Mrs. McLane. <\/p>\n<p>Ada May apparently held no such illusions of renewed connubial bliss; her body was found by a friend who came to check on her after she told him her husband had threatened her life on several recent occasions.  <\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>November 20, 1927Los Angeles There are criminal masterminds, and then there are men like William E.
