The metal bent against bone, and &quot;Happy&quot; pulled it out again, twisted and useless. <\/p>\n<p>Then he made a run for the door, but he obviously hadn&#8217;t noticed Patrolman French, who was in the telephone booth. Hearing the commotion, French stepped out with revolver drawn and stopped the would-be slayer at the scene. Farrel was rushed to Loamshire Hospital, Santa Monica, in serious condition, and &quot;Happy&quot; held on charges of attempted murder.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, all this might have been avoided, had Farrel checked his employee&#8217;s references.
