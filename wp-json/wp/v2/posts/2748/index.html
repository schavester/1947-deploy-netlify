Parzyjegla, 38, who on February 15 killed his boss, Alfred Haij, publisher of the Swedish newspaper <a href=\"http:\/\/64.233.167.104\/search?q=cache:nVS7IHu3ShUJ:www.balchinstitute.org\/manuscript_guide\/html\/swedish.html+%22California+Veckoblad%22&#038;hl=en&#038;start=4&#038;client=firefox-a\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">California Veckoblad<\/span><\/a>, in the paper\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s print shop at <a href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?q=821+Venice+Blvd,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90015&#038;hl=en\">821 W. Venice Blvd.<\/a> and dismembered him with a blade from the paper cutter.<\/p>\n<p>The two men had been arguing for weeks, and February 15 was to be Parzyjegla\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s last day, with a new operator due to arrive from San Francisco. Parzyjegla claimed that despite his being let go, he still took his job seriously.<\/p>\n<p>Parzyjegla: I told Haij that the linotype machine needed attention. All of a sudden he ran wild and said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c5\u201cYou dirty German, you aren\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2t going to run my business.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u009d<\/p>\n<p>Parzyjegla, who is a Russian-born Pole, was held prisoner in a German concentration camp, during which incarceration he was tortured by standing in a fake execution by firing squad. He claims that being called a German, and a dirty one at that, triggered a dreamlike flashback state, during which he beat his employer to death. Then he pinched and hit himself, hoping to wake up, and realized it was real.<\/p>\n<p>Within minutes, several people walked into Haij\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s office asking for the publisher. Parzyjegla said that he was out, and locked the door. All day, Parzyjegla sat in the print shop with Haij\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s body, wondering what to do. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c5\u201cFinally I thought of the blade on the paper cutter.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u009d Wrapping rags around the blade, Parzyjegla dismembered Haij and packed the parts into cartons, cleaned the floor and burned the rags, Then he went home to <a href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?q=415+E+Jefferson+Blvd,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90011&#038;hl=en\">415 W. Jefferson Blvd.<\/a>, his 21-year-old wife and infant child. Around midnight, having been unable to sleep, Parzyjegla returned to the print shop with idle thoughts of disposing of the body\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009dmaybe he could rent a car, take it someplace\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009dbut police, alerted when Haij failed to return home to <a href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?q=1445+S.+Hayworth+Ave.,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;hl=en\">1445 S. Hayworth Ave.<\/a>, were already in the vicinity.<\/p>\n<p>Radio Patrolmen B.H. Brown and A.J. Drobatz spotted Parzyjegla in front of <a href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?q=cherry+street,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;spn=0.035522,0.052443&#038;hl=en\">1609 Cherry St.<\/a>, in the act of tossing Haij\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s watch away, and observing his cut hand, took him to the print shop. There Parzyjegla promptly confessed and acted out the assault and dismemberment.<\/p>\n<p>Noting that one of the anonymous Black Dahlia confession letters had clearly been prepared in a print shop, Captain Jack Donahoe of Homicide Division expressed interest in Parzyjegla and arranged a line up where six recent female assault victims tried and failed to recognize him.<\/p>\n<p>In Superior Court today, in a juryless trial before Judge William R. McKay, Parzyjegla repeated that since 1939 he has been subject to black outs and \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c5\u201cseeing red,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u009d which he claims that he did before striking Haij. McKay convicted Parzyjegla of second degree murder, and invited him back on Thursday for sentencing of between five years and life.<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>May 26, 1947Los Angeles Angelenos will recall the shocking case of linotype operator Otto P.
