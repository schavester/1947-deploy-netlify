We&#8217;ve already received some fascinating submissions&#8211;including one for the first public appearance in more than a decade of a legendary L.A. postpunk band, presenting a live score to a Melies Brothers short &#8212; and would love to have you be a part of it. So send over your ideas, half-baked or cooked straight through, and join us on March 22 at Bedlam.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>1907 Centennial &#8211; open call for performers<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For the past year, the bloggers at 1947project.com have been immersed in the weird old L.A. of 1907, a city of open sewers and Mexican revolutionaries, 15mph hot rodders and prankster firemen, holy rollers and hollow earthers. As the calendar strikes March and the conclusion of twelve months of 1907 research, we&#8217;re hosting a special centennial celebration, and we&#8217;d like YOU to be a part of it.<\/p>\n<p>Writers, musicians, actors, artists, comics, storytellers, vaudevillians, curators, filmmakers, historians, poets and others are invited to propose a 3-10 minute presentation on a theme inspired by 1907-era Los Angeles (or the wider world). Your piece can be original or an adaptation of something you&#8217;ve read on 1947project.com or elsewhere. All media are welcome (we can provide amplification and video projection). The only requirements are that it be entertaining and respectful to any crime victims involved.<\/p>\n<p>Prospective presenters should provide the following:<br \/>1) A one paragraph creative bio, 200 words or less, suitable for publication <br \/>2) A description of what you propose to do at the 1907 Centennial event, noting any source material that you have been inspired by<br \/>3) Length of proposed performance<br \/>4) Contact info <br \/>5) Your website or other helpful links<\/p>\n<p>Event curators Kim Cooper, Larry Harnisch, Lucinda Michele Knapp and Nathan Marsak will be collecting proposals through February 5 and announcing the line up shortly afterwards. The &#8217;07 celebration will be held on Thursday, March 22 at Bedlam Art downtown, and will culminate in the festive revelation by a very special musical guest of which historic year will next get the archival treatment from 1947project. The event will be free, with refreshments and libations on hand. Vintage recipes will be provided for those who enjoy cooking to contribute pot luck offerings to share.<\/p>\n<p>Need more info to stoke the fires of your creativity?
