A neighbor&#8217;s child was over a few days ago and was bitten on the arm.  Instead of taking responsibility for raising a beastly child that doesn&#8217;t know not to torment dogs, the evil neighbor requested of City officials that the dog be killed.<\/p>\n<p>The City Marshall went to the home of Mr. Edwards and rightfully requested that Mr. Edwards be more careful with the dog in the future, while the neighbor still held that the dog be killed.  The Marshall departed but the neighbor kept at it, and dog owner Edwards finally consented to have the dog murdered.<\/p>\n<p>The neighbor walked the dog down the Fullerton railroad tracks and shot him.  The dog rolled over and after a few minutes stopped kicking.  The neighbor returned to town and reported that the deed was done. <\/p>\n<p>That night in the Edwards home the mantle clock ticked in earnest in its dreadful march to midnight when, moments before it chimed twelve, there was a scraping at the door.  Mrs. Edwards opened it.  &#8220;Is this the ghost of the dog or am I dreaming,&#8221; she said to herself.  Mr. Edwards rubbed his eyes and nearly toppled over as he joined his shocked wife in watching the dog crawl toward them&#8211;coming slowly forward&#8211;until as the dog shook his head a ball fell from his jaw.  Mr. Edwards says the dog will live.  Hopefully it will finish off that family next door.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>May 7, 1907 Fullerton Constable Edwards has a bulldog that his children have been playing with for two years.
