A girl buried under her family&#8217;s home. A rattlesnake used as a weapon.<\/p>\n<p>The scenes of those crimes are stops on a series of Southern California bus tours that eschew the usual stars&#8217; homes and theme parks to offer passengers a peak at the region&#8217;s dark side.<\/p>\n<p>&quot;They&#8217;re aimed at the history geek sort of people,&quot; said Kelly Kuvo, who wears a black veil and other vintage accouterments during the trips she leads for tour company Esotouric.<\/p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s &quot;crime bus&quot; tours plumb the grisly, blood-soaked pasts of now quiet Southern California neighborhoods and nondescript strip malls.<\/p>\n<p>Similar trips elsewhere take passengers deep into cities&#8217; gory pasts, including Washington&#8217;s &quot;Bad Olde Days&quot; chronicling crime in the nation&#8217;s capital and &quot;Sinister London&quot; that follows the steps of Jack the Ripper.<\/p>\n<p>&quot;When people die in a place, it does change that place forever,&quot; said Esotouric guide and co-founder Kim Cooper. &quot;Just because the people wandering around the neighborhood may not be aware of it, it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not a good idea for people who are interested in history to revive those memories.&quot;<\/p>\n<p>John G. Cawelti, who writes about the seductiveness of violent crime tales in his book &quot;Mystery, Violence, and Popular Culture,&quot; said the tours play into people&#8217;s fears of death and catastrophe.<\/p>\n<p>&quot;We live in an age where the worst kinds of things can happen to anybody,&quot; Cawelti said. &quot;Walk down the street and something blows up and all of a sudden you lost your life or lost a leg. The fact that somebody else went through this becomes a surrogate &ndash; a magical way of charming away the fear of the possibility.&quot;<\/p>\n<p>Esotouric&#8217;s most popular tour explores 1947 Los Angeles by zeroing in on the murder of Elizabeth Short &ndash; a.k.a. &quot;Black Dahlia&quot; &ndash; who came to Hollywood in search of fame but wound up the victim of an infamous unsolved murder.<\/p>\n<p>One stop is a ground-floor storefront on a desolate downtown street that now boasts a sign reading, &quot;Club Galaxy &ndash; 100 Beautiful Girls.&quot;<\/p>\n<p>In 1947, when it was a bistro called &quot;The Crown Grill,&quot; it was the last place Short was seen before her dismembered body was discovered miles away in a south Los Angeles neighborhood.<\/p>\n<p>&quot;She was friendly with the bartenders and with some of the waitresses, so people recognized her and remembered her,&quot; Cooper said. &quot;The problem of course is that everybody at the Crown Grill immediately became suspects.&quot;<\/p>\n<p>Passengers are also introduced to lesser known crimes from the same year, such as the attempted carjacking in Hollywood of an 18-year-old movie theater cashier named Ginevra Knight, who shot her assailant dead.<\/p>\n<p>&quot;It&#8217;s the criminal history of 1947 L.A. and how women felt going out at night in the hysteria of an unsolved murder,&quot; Cooper said.<\/p>\n<p>The &quot;Blood and Dumplings&quot; tour through San Gabriel Valley suburbs, meanwhile, passes the home where a young bride-to-be was buried in 1969 by her uncle after he shot her to death in a jealous rage at the end of their affair.<\/p>\n<p>It also cruises by an intersection where a man named Raymond James bought a rattlesnake he let bite his wife in 1935 so he could cash in on her insurance policy. When she didn&#8217;t die, he had an accomplice finish the job by drowning her in their fish pond.<\/p>\n<p>Esotouric grew out of a Web log Cooper started in 2005, when she set out to retell a true-crime tale from each day of 1947. She and her collaborators soon started offering tours of those scenes and the sites of other crimes.<\/p>\n<p>A tour that revisits the life and literature of Raymond Chandler, whose fictional characters inhabit the region&#8217;s underworld, was added to the menu of crime junkets when the company was started earlier this year.<\/p>\n<p>Tour participant Bob Nickum, 59, a school district business manager, said seeing the sites of past crimes made him look at familiar places in a new way.<\/p>\n<p>&quot;It&#8217;s just very interesting to drive around the area and to see things I may have passed by many times and maybe not known what happened there,&quot; said Nickum, who, like most passengers, lives in Southern California.<\/p>\n<p>&quot;It makes things a little more interesting &ndash; vivid &ndash; to know about something that intense that took place in a calm, peaceful neighborhood,&quot; he said.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Photo Sharing\" href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/richardschave\/487557160\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Nathan Heather and Kelly\" src=\"\/\/farm1.static.flickr.com\/168\/487557160_02588d149e.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p align=\"right\"><strong>Nathan Marsak, chess shark Heather and Kelly at the Hotel Barclay<br \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>by Jacob Adelman for the Associated Press (AP Photo\/Damian Dovarganes) Above: Kelly Kuvo, the Blonde Dahlia &nbsp; LOS ANGELES &#8212; A dismembered wannabe starlet.
