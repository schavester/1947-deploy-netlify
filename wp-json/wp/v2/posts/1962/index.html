King, 25, X-ray technician out Alhambra way, who denies causing the accident, though he admits he used his siren while not on an official call. Well, since he&#8217;s a doctor, they book King on charges of failing to stop and render aid at an accident scene, and hold him in the City Jail. Meanwhile, we trust, police mechanics are cutting that siren off the Essex, and none to carefully, either.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>May 24, 1927Los Angeles Whoo-Whoo!
