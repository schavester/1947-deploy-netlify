us.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In short, I&#8217;ve played it.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>Last Saturday, Richard Schave, Kim Cooper and I were led from the Roosevelt Hotel&#8217;s sun-and-skin drenched poolside<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\/\/farm6.static.flickr.com\/5261\/5636545871_3c213908e6_o.jpg\" alt=\"sunandskin\" width=\"600\" height=\"267\" \/><\/p>\n<p>up into one of its dark, curtain-pulled rooms.&nbsp;

Mostly gamers from fansites, whom I&#8217;m sure picked apart the roguelike procedural sandbox algorithms, about which I confess to know nothing.&nbsp; (Did play <em>ToeJam &amp; Earl in Panic on Funkotron<\/em> all the way through in <a title=\"TJaE\" href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kEz4c9zwefI\" target=\"_blank\">1993 <\/a>and said Ok, I&#8217;ve done <em>that<\/em>.&nbsp; Went boating once, too, and again, figured once was enough.)&nbsp; Kim&#8217;s no gamer either.&nbsp; So we abjured the gameplay and I therefore can comment neither on <em>LA Noire&#8217;s<\/em> authority as a &#8220;game&#8221; nor on how it succeeds in its mimetic vs. diegetic structure.&nbsp; I was there to look at <em>stuff<\/em>.&nbsp; Their company rep in our room gave us a half-hour (which we stretched into an hour) to tool around Old LA &#8212; an hour of incessant mumbles and rants that surely came off as so much demented logorrhea.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>All of which I&#8217;ll share with you now.&nbsp; Will endeavor to imbue it with some measure of coherence one notch above logorrhea; can&#8217;t guarantee it won&#8217;t be demented.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>First thing I did was study <em>LAN<\/em>&#8216;s greater map.&nbsp; It&#8217;s an oblong affair, kind of a boomerang shape, roughly bordered by Franklin on the north, the river at the east, Olympic along the south, and La Brea at the west.&nbsp; Within these boundaries there are, I was told, eight miles of perfectly rendered roads to traverse.&nbsp; And I fully intended to put this topography to test in the limited time I had.<\/p>\n<p>So we jumped into the world.&nbsp; Commenced inside Central Police Division, the 1896 &#8220;Old Central&#8221; at the SW corner of First and Hill&nbsp; (demolished in 1956, a year after Parker Center opened, natch).&nbsp; There was some ambient gametalk about how I was one Cole Phelps, former Marine and newly-minted LAPD detective, which was all fine and good when, as I ambled down some hallway, I glanced out of the side of my Phelpsian eye the view through the window and espied a <em>great dusty promontory<\/em>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Oh, I knew it well all right.&nbsp; It loomed over First; the Hill Street Tunnel bored through it.&nbsp; That the game designers could get something <em>that correct<\/em> through some random dirty window, well, that bode well.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\/\/farm6.static.flickr.com\/5012\/5532599527_e531dfbf79.jpg\" alt=\"shockproof\" width=\"500\" height=\"401\" \/><em><\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Above, aforementioned &#8220;dusty promontory&#8221;

without a thought I roughly pushed past the odd dirty desk and water cooler, shoving aside my fellow officer until at once, after a lifetime of waiting, I bolted out into the daylight.&nbsp; The 1947 daylight.&nbsp; Blinked my eyes in wonder.&nbsp; A red car trolley clattered past.&nbsp; Turned and peered down First at Austin&#8217;s <a title=\"state bldg\" href=\"http:\/\/jpg2.lapl.org\/pics17\/00018368.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">State Building <\/a>looming in the distance.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not ashamed to say I found the moment absolutely thrilling.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>Ran into the street, badged some broad in a shiny new Hudson, commandeered her car and set off for Bunker Hill, every synapse firing.&nbsp; Some <a title=\"semaphore\" href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/33455118@N08\/4773651309\/lightbox\/\" target=\"_blank\">semaphore<\/a> dared raise its &#8220;stop&#8221; signal at me and I blew through the intersection, neatly clipping a Caddy, fishtailing onto the sidewalk, sending pedestrians scurrying.&nbsp; (All at once I could see the appeal of this thing.)&nbsp; But my car, and neurons, came to a screeching halt as I hit Second and Hill &#8212; for there, instead of roadbed running up to Olive, were only stairs alongside the tunnel.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\/\/farm6.static.flickr.com\/5067\/5641527654_fd621bf62b_o.jpg\" alt=\"second\" width=\"600\" height=\"408\" \/><a title=\"cushman\" href=\"http:\/\/webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu\/cushman\/results\/detail.do?query=angeles&amp;page=3&amp;pagesize=20&amp;display=thumbcap&amp;action=search&amp;pnum=P05739\" target=\"_blank\"><em>cushman<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Which was just&#8230;<a title=\"wrong\" href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/basicshape\/4523703115\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>wrong<\/em><\/a>.&nbsp;

This game&#8217;s early promise was dwindlling rapidly.&nbsp; The Hillcrest had a butcher instead of its <a title=\"reagh image of Hillcrest\" href=\"http:\/\/helios.library.ca.gov\/soca\/reagh\/1990-0944.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">dry cleaners<\/a>?&nbsp; This was <em>not<\/em> boding well.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The most-used phrase to describe <em>LA Noire<\/em> is &#8220;<a title=\"perfectlyrecreated\" href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=la+noire+perfectly+recreated&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a\" target=\"_blank\">perfectly recreated<\/a>.&#8221;&nbsp; Now, let me say that I&#8217;m not trying to be needlessly critical, but this <em>is<\/em> criticism after all, and it&#8217;s the only kind of criticism I do.&nbsp; A post such as this merely underscores that we at 1947p take our re-presentation of a world dear to our hearts with unyielding gravity.&nbsp; To put it nicely, omission of oft-photographed (disinclude <a title=\"AFP\" href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/39303931@N05\/5432381179\/in\/photostream\" target=\"_blank\">Angels Flight Pharmacy<\/a>?&nbsp; Really?) buildings is a bit perplexing.&nbsp; That the repetition of perplexing omissions was disheartening and maddening I trust is a given.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I queried some of the game guys afterward about why some landmarks might be missing, and they posited that it could be because Corporate couldn&#8217;t secure the rights to images of those structures.&nbsp; A possibility, but not a probability.&nbsp; For example, back in <em>Noire<\/em>&#8216;s LA, I cruised up Third to Grand.&nbsp; Looking north, at the NW corner, there stood <a title=\"301 S G\" href=\"http:\/\/jpg3.lapl.org\/pics13\/00026490.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">301\/303 S Grand<\/a>, AKA 725 W 3rd.&nbsp; Shots of this house are pretty rare.&nbsp; But across the street at the NE corner, there was no <a title=\"Nugent\" href=\"http:\/\/onbunkerhill.org\/NugentNewGrand\" target=\"_blank\">Nugent<\/a>, nor, at the SE corner, was there <a title=\"lovjoy\" href=\"http:\/\/onbunkerhill.org\/LoveandDeathattheLovejoy\" target=\"_blank\">the Lovejoy<\/a>, which have both been captured to great degree.&nbsp; Thus it was with some trepidation I walked up to Bunker Hill Avenue &#8212; <em>which wasn&#8217;t there<\/em>.&nbsp; It had been reconfigured as an alleyway.&nbsp; <a title=\"bha\" href=\"http:\/\/onbunkerhill.org\/taxonomy_menu\/4\/12\" target=\"_blank\">Bunker Hill Avenue<\/a> is unusually, unreasonably important to Los Angeles, mid-Century especially; noir pictures were shot there, for example, <a title=\"the castle\" href=\"http:\/\/onbunkerhill.org\/castle\" target=\"_blank\">The Castle<\/a> was used in <a title=\"kmd\" href=\"http:\/\/farm5.static.flickr.com\/4070\/4637735538_13b8ec4118_o.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Kiss Me Deadly<\/a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;

(Don&#8217;t <em>even<\/em> get me started on where they put the terminus of the Third Street tunnel.)<\/p>\n<p>So I trudged back to town.&nbsp; At least I could ride <a title=\"af\" href=\"http:\/\/www.electricearl.com\/af\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Angels Flight<\/a> down to Hill, right?&nbsp; Nope, in this world Angels Flight is <em>stationary<\/em>.&nbsp; I can plow a beautifully rendered Packard Deluxe Clipper 8 Club Sedan through three blocks of streetlights, but can&#8217;t ride the arguably most iconic piece of Angelenic transportation 315 feet?&nbsp; With streets replete with DeSotos and crisscrossing streetcars, 1947 the height of its ridership, Angels Flight sits as motionless as it did during its <a title=\"af\" href=\"http:\/\/abclocal.go.com\/kabc\/story?section=news\/local\/los_angeles&amp;id=7331708\" target=\"_blank\">down days<\/a>.&nbsp; This too I brought up to one of the reps, and was told that what I was playing wasn&#8217;t the final version, and that perhaps a running funicular was to be, but just, you know, not in this &#8220;build.&#8221;&nbsp; I believe what he was attempting to connote was that I was playing an old version.&nbsp; So there&#8217;s your caveat, dear reader:&nbsp; perhaps everything I&#8217;m saying is based on some outdated model.&nbsp; Perhaps everything I&#8217;m bitching about is being fixed <em>right now<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Naturally my most stringent criticism was going to be reserved for <a href=\"http:\/\/onbunkerhill.org\/\">Bunker Hill<\/a>;

As an oil man by trade, my reigning interest was in motoring down to the <a title=\"gas holders\" href=\"http:\/\/forum.skyscraperpage.com\/showthread.php?t=170279&amp;page=180\" target=\"_blank\">gas holders<\/a> the other side of Union Station.&nbsp;

<\/p>\n<p>But it was the <a title=\"sa\" href=\"http:\/\/jpg1.lapl.org\/pics26\/00032670.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Spring Arcade<\/a>&#8230;that really showed me the true virtue of the game.&nbsp; I was busy crashing Chryslers, gazing gape-mouthed as I pummeled pedestrians, blah dee blah, video game stuff, when I <em>screeeee<\/em> parked my car lengthwise across Broadway.&nbsp; Exited said car, walked with dedicated purpose across the street &#8212; traffic came to a halt, ladies in veils waved their begloved fists at me &#8212; and I stepped into the quietude of the Spring Arcade.&nbsp; It was a revelation.&nbsp; Deep into our maniacal race to experience all we could see in this recreated world, I was now in the Arcade sans crap electronics and discount socks:&nbsp; a place of peace and elegance, as anathematic to 1947 as it is to 2011.&nbsp; People of 2011 (that&#8217;s you) can and should traverse what is LA&#8217;s most sublime space.&nbsp; That you may imagine its former glory, courtesy of and via this game, is rather lovely. <\/p>\n<p>Would that it were all hearts and rainbows, though.&nbsp; There were problems:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The Westminster lacked its trademark sunburst <a title=\"westminster\" href=\"http:\/\/farm6.static.flickr.com\/5269\/5638709909_5b9f898920_b.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">canopies<\/a>.&nbsp; And consider <a title=\"San Carlos\" href=\"http:\/\/onbunkerhill.org\/Auditorium\/SanCarlosHotel\" target=\"_blank\">the San Carlos<\/a>:&nbsp; in the <em>Noire<\/em> version of &#8217;47 reality, the San Carlos exists, structurally, somewhere between its original &#8220;wedding cake&#8221; incarnation of 1911 and its 1930s cleanlining, i.e., there was an apparent misalignment in the matter transporter integrator\/disentgrator device (shameless plug for the &#8217;58 version of <a title=\"fly\" href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=621mwvO_-Zc\" target=\"_blank\">The Fly<\/a>) because here the San Carlos retains its Auditorium-era finials, though in a mutated streamline version.&nbsp;

its bump-n-grind 1947 reality would have actually made this landscape more noir.&nbsp; (I might add that in <em>Noire&#8217;s<\/em> world LA&#8217;s picture-houses, according to their maquees, featured the same few 1947 noir films, and ignored the dictate of Warner&#8217;s showing Warners, RKO showing theirs, etc.)&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Where was the Follies&#8217;

We tore down Wilshire &#8212; as much as I love the 60s Corporate Brutalism of DMJM&#8217;s <a title=\"ac\" href=\"http:\/\/www.you-are-here.com\/modern\/cement.html\" target=\"_blank\">American Cement<\/a>, its absence certainly put me squarely in the game&#8217;s frame.&nbsp; But even with the Gaylord in the distance, Wilshire petered out before we hit The Ambassador.&nbsp; Yes, our first instance where we had come to The End of Our World.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t play games; I drive around LA.&nbsp; So I don&#8217;t take roadblocks lightly.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I was at the mercy of a higher power.&nbsp; Not the AA kind.&nbsp; The <a title=\"13f\" href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KkEHcB4y7R8\" target=\"_blank\">Thirteenth Floor<\/a> kind.<\/p>\n<p>So as I so often do (especially when confronted with a higher power), I went another way.&nbsp;

should you want to know where you are, you have to jump out of gameplay and into a map) and into Hollywoodland.&nbsp; I could give just as detailed a description of Hollywood as I did for downtown (to which I did a disservice by not seeing a tenth of what I intended to) but I&#8217;ll save that, I think.&nbsp; Something tells me this won&#8217;t be the last of this nitpickery.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, for the time being, seeing <a title=\"sardi's\" href=\"http:\/\/jpg3.lapl.org\/pics45\/00072113.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Sardi&#8217;s<\/a> in the flesh, so to speak, was charming.&nbsp; That I went to bed that night replaying how I clipped a Chrysler Airflow and slammed my midnight blue &#8217;47 Lincoln Continental convertible into the <a title=\"nbc\" href=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/_Y38IW_SOQIw\/RxJVHVxyF7I\/AAAAAAAACbg\/Gvsj0z59q7I\/s1600-h\/SunsetVine6.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">NBC building<\/a>&#8230;priceless.&nbsp; On the other hand, one of my mussitations while motoring along Sunset was &#8220;If the globe on <a title=\"xroads\" href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/hollywoodhistory\/4047674269\/\" target=\"_blank\">Crossroads<\/a> is spinning the right way, I&#8217;ll buy this thing.&#8221;&nbsp; Not only not the right way, but not spinning.&nbsp; At all.&nbsp; Like Angels Flight, it was stationary.&nbsp; And did I mention it wasn&#8217;t a globe?&nbsp; Just a blue ball.<\/p>\n<p>How apt.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>And thusly we were done.&nbsp; I tossed the controller to the floor and breathed a bit.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>Ushered back out poolside, where all was well-lit, well-oiled and eumorphous.&nbsp; I wanted to cry, <em>Don&#8217;t you know where you are?<\/em>&nbsp; But I guess what I really meant was <em>Don&#8217;t you know where I&#8217;ve been?<\/em>&nbsp; Richard drove us back to Lincoln Heights.&nbsp; I was in an impatient state of anxiety over his unwillingness to blow through intersections and use sidewalks as his motorway.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>As we drove home, the streets were uncrowded, the sky was sunny.&nbsp; Just as it was in&#8230;<em>LA Noire<\/em>.&nbsp; Which raises the question &#8212; what?&nbsp; Los Angeles was <a title=\"traffic\" href=\"http:\/\/jpg3.lapl.org\/pics37\/00068476.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">famously<\/a> <a title=\"la\" href=\"http:\/\/jpg1.lapl.org\/pics25\/00032497.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">congested<\/a> in 1947.&nbsp; Moreover, 1947 LA was <a title=\"polluty\" href=\"http:\/\/1947project.blogspot.com\/2005\/06\/co-ed-whipping-laid-to-student.html\" target=\"_blank\">poisonously<\/a> <a title=\"polluted\" href=\"http:\/\/farm6.static.flickr.com\/5310\/5638632287_047cd1eb85_b.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">polluted<\/a>.&nbsp; My synapses sprang back to life, whence came new questions:&nbsp; having only traversed the <em>Noire<\/em> landscape in daylight, what does nighttime look like?&nbsp; (Are the animated signs animated, e.g., the bowling neon <a title=\"vineneon\" href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/33455118@N08\/4645046350\/in\/photostream\/#\/photos\/33455118@N08\/4645046350\/in\/photostream\/lightbox\/\" target=\"_blank\">on Vine<\/a> or the bowling incandescent <a title=\"jensens\" href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/imgres?imgurl=http:\/\/www.echoparknow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/Jensens_Relight.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http:\/\/www.echoparknow.com\/2010\/10\/29\/flashback-fridays-jensens-recreation-center-sign\/&amp;usg=__JM-JDTaKzFyqXqQAvjR0AwsC5-U=&amp;h=450&amp;w=355&amp;sz=80&amp;hl=en&amp;start=17&amp;zoom=1&amp;itbs=1&amp;tbnid=jW35QsgomzomPM:&amp;tbnh=127&amp;tbnw=100&amp;prev=\/search%3Fq%3Djensen%2527s%2Brecreation%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26client%3Dsafari%26sa%3DX%26rls%3Den%26tbm%3Disch%26prmd%3Divns&amp;ei=OGyvTY2mIoi2sAPlxOmSAw\" target=\"_blank\">on Sunset<\/a>?&nbsp;

(As I drive down Central to bop with the heads, how do the demographics shift?&nbsp; Or up Broadway into New Chinatown?&nbsp; If faces are actually Asian there, will they differentiate in any way from those in our Sh\u00c5\u008d-t\u00c5\u008dky\u00c5\u008d?)<\/p>\n<p>We wound through the streets.&nbsp; I closed my eyes and tried to keep close to 1947 LA.&nbsp; Traffic roared by, but it didn&#8217;t sound quite correct.&nbsp; I mean, a Pontiac Streamliner 8 sounds like nothing else in the world.&nbsp; So my final muttering of the day was <em>vedremo<\/em>.&nbsp; <em>Vedremo<\/em>.&nbsp; Those Germans, they may have a word for everything, but the Italians, they only have words for those things that absolutely matter.&nbsp; A favorite of theirs, heard across pre-unification &#8220;Italy,&#8221; was\/is <em>vedremo<\/em>.&nbsp; It means <em>we shall see<\/em>.&nbsp; We shall see, indeed.<\/p>\n<p>But I live now.&nbsp; It&#8217;s been a couple days and I&#8217;ve cogitated a spell.&nbsp; If you&#8217;ve read this far, it won&#8217;t shock you to hear that I don&#8217;t cotton to anachronism.&nbsp; But Mr. Nathan, I hear you say, Renaissance art was the rebirth of antiquity, but you nevertheless routinely witness The Virgin in 15th c. Italian dress and the Four Fathers in Flemmish garb all the time.&nbsp; I would counter that the <em>renovatio<\/em> was about the remaking of a living culture through the interjection of Greco-Roman concepts of perfection, and if you want to continue your argument, I know, town clocks didn&#8217;t strike in the ancient Rome of Shakespeare&#8217;s <em>Julius Ceasar<\/em> either.&nbsp; Anachronism in the commission of art, is not only nothing new, but is <a title=\"geniuses\" href=\"http:\/\/movies.yahoo.com\/feature\/10mosthistoricallyinaccurate.html\" target=\"_blank\">common currency<\/a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m not writing about those.&nbsp; I&#8217;m writing about this.&nbsp; It purports to be historical, and when that happens, I&#8217;m on the case.&nbsp; I&#8217;m Cole-Fucking-Phelps.&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>Thus I am a detective, present day, but with retrocognitive disorder.&nbsp; Retrocognition is the concept that one can view a place and see into it its variegated layers of the past.&nbsp; While I may appear flippant on the subject, trust me, it&#8217;s a difficult state of perception to harbor or describe.&nbsp; The German critic Walter Benjamin described the <em>colportage<\/em> phenomenon of space, wherein &#8220;we simultaneously perceive all the events which might conceivably have taken place here.&#8221;&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t see Los Angeles, historically, as collapsed space; I see it as an artichoke, where one must peel back layers to reveal its heart.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s also an onion.&nbsp; Peel away its layers, find nothing inside, end up crying.<\/p>\n<p>Neither 1947 Los Angeles nor its progeny <em>LA Noire<\/em> merely exist within the <em>colportage<\/em>; this game is being entered into the historiography of postwar Los Angeles.&nbsp; That canon is unbearably important (you know, to some of us), but who are its keepers?&nbsp; From March 2005 on, there was us at 47p.&nbsp; As has been discussed on this site, <em>Ask the Dust<\/em> <a title=\"AtD\" href=\"http:\/\/onbunkerhill.org\/AsktheDust\" target=\"_blank\">didn&#8217;t look quite right<\/a>, and DePalma&#8217;s 1947-fest <em>Black Dahlia<\/em>, released the year <em>LA Noire<\/em> was announced, shot as it was in Bulgaria, didn&#8217;t look quite right <a title=\"thelesssaidthebetter\" href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4UK1B0nSi94\" target=\"_blank\">either<\/a>.&nbsp; Those two movies were of course seen by a sum total of eleven people.&nbsp; Of HBO&#8217;s recent <em>Mildred Pierce<\/em> &#8212; tossing in a handful of palm trees and some <a title=\"MP\" href=\"http:\/\/forum.skyscraperpage.com\/showpost.php?p=5229014&amp;postcount=3482\" target=\"_blank\">awkward CGI<\/a> couldn&#8217;t change the quality of that New York light.&nbsp; <em>MP<\/em> was seen by about a million people.&nbsp; Rockstar&#8217;s most recent venture, <em>Grand Theft Auto IV<\/em>, has sold <a title=\"gta\" href=\"http:\/\/www.vg247.com\/2011\/03\/10\/take-two-drops-franchise-figures-gta-iv-sells-20-million-bioshock-series-at-8-million\/\" target=\"_blank\">twenty million<\/a> units.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>Noire<\/em> shall then be the introduction for many to the wonderful world of 1947 Los Angeles, and as they learn it in its eidetic state, they are going to come away with a view of the City at a place in time that is <em>almost<\/em>, but <em>not quite<\/em>.&nbsp; If they learn it here first, then, when they subsequently see it presented accurately, they&#8217;ll figure the simulacrum to be the true version.&nbsp; (If this paragraph incites just one discussion about teleology and metanarrative, that would be awesome.&nbsp; If it makes you think about the <a title=\"bathgate\" href=\"http:\/\/jpg2.lapl.org\/pics19\/00019150.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Bath Block<\/a>, that would be better.)<\/p>\n<p>Coleridge was all up in our grill about willingly suspending disbelief.&nbsp; As such, I&#8217;d like to think the onus was solely on me, infinitely forgiving the game designers, and overlooking the limitations of the media &#8212; but I can&#8217;t.&nbsp; I understand that when I watch <em>Life On Mars<\/em>, set in the 70s, it&#8217;s low budget; they can&#8217;t remove every incorrect park bench and satellite antenna.&nbsp; That the Coens <a title=\"carl archer\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ew.com\/ew\/gallery\/0,,20208436_20473872,00.html\" target=\"_blank\">couldn&#8217;t expunge<\/a> some modern Carl&#8217;s Jr. signage from their set-in-1980 <em>No Country for Old Men<\/em>, well, <em>fine<\/em>&#8230;their budget was a mere twenty-five million dollars.&nbsp; But <em>LA Noire<\/em> is total fantasy, drawn (literally) (no, not literally, because they &#8220;capture&#8221; these things, but anyway) from images, and its budget is fifty, <a title=\"dolla dolla\" href=\"http:\/\/n4g.com\/news\/202900\/l-a-noire-the-most-expensive-game-in-development\" target=\"_blank\">maybe<\/a> a hundred million dollars.&nbsp; So forgive me should I seem to hold these gents to unreasonably high standards.&nbsp; In layman&#8217;s terms, I&#8217;m not sayin&#8217;, I&#8217;m just sayin&#8217;:&nbsp; the past has as its nature an irretrievability and should someone attempt to articulate it, they are opening themselves up to rearticulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>To wit:&nbsp; I think there&#8217;s a certain Whiggishness at work here, and rightfully so.&nbsp; LA of <em>Noire<\/em> is portrayed in all the glory of its expanse, after all, 1940s LA affluence and vastness took countless untolds out of the slums of the East.&nbsp; Its portrayal here is at the same time a revisionist history, in that LA&#8217;s skies are rendered blue and her streets rasterized as nearly empty.&nbsp; I have not, of course, touched on the whole &#8220;1947 LA is thick with serial killers and corruption&#8221; history, because I did not technically <em>play<\/em> the game.&nbsp; From perusing the R* site, seems like they&#8217;ve an angle as regards the Jeanne French killing.&nbsp; As &#8220;crime buff&#8221; falls under the umbrella of social historian, I have come to know, and from there have become close to, Jeanne French.&nbsp; Not Ellroy\/Short close, but, still, don&#8217;t like to see her memory played with.&nbsp;

how, if at all, will they be fictionalized in this game?&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>Obviously, I want the world of 1947 treated with some respect.&nbsp; <em>Noire&#8217;s<\/em> designers did a commendable job, and were not lazy in attempting to achieve great things.&nbsp; But let me have a parting shot at this &#8220;<a title=\"perfectlyrecreated\" href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=la+noire+perfectly+recreated&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a\" target=\"_blank\">perfectly recreated<\/a>&#8221; business &#8212; the pundits routinely repeat it.&nbsp; I expect lazy journalism.&nbsp; But let&#8217;s say 1947 LA <em>was<\/em> perfectly recreated.&nbsp; By whom?&nbsp; Obviously not by someone with phenomenological understanding of the time and place (though such folk do exist, they are now really rather unreliable, God bless &#8217;em) so it must therefore be done by historians&#8230;many of whom I know, none I which were ever contacted.&nbsp; Personally, I&#8217;ve never been to the past, nor have the game&#8217;s designers or builders, or scripters.&nbsp; Therefore <em>LA Noire<\/em> has an enormous burden to bear regarding its legacy &#8212; and if they&#8217;d worked on it another five years, would they reach a level of accuracy that would be acceptable to me?&nbsp; Even if I gave it an A-1 rating, wouldn&#8217;t some upstart still pick it apart?<\/p>\n<p><em>Noire<\/em>, I&#8217;m assuming, will be an international success.&nbsp; The upside being it will introduce the public to a world they may have never considered:&nbsp; e.g., one without computers and cell phones.&nbsp; Will players perceive this as a pro or con?&nbsp; How and why might they reinterpret their present via time spent in the past?&nbsp; We may romanticize the past, but nothing&#8217;s sugar-coated in noir.&nbsp; Murder is one thing; it&#8217;s eternal.&nbsp; 1947&#8217;s specific relationship to race and gender and class is something else altogether, and what players take away from living in that world, for however short a spell, will be telling.&nbsp; Heck, would it be cooler to play the game wth a case of typhoid or TB?&nbsp; One can only hope the millions who navigate this new (old) world take from it something useful and interesting.&nbsp; (Maybe they&#8217;ll even go and investigate some <a title=\"criss cross\" href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CLH1wbtDEQw\" target=\"_blank\">old noir<\/a> thereby freeing up a seat for a <a title=\"yaaaay\" href=\"http:\/\/www.rottentomatoes.com\/guides\/worst_of_the_worst\/1\/\" target=\"_blank\">good movie.<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>But here&#8217;s the thing.&nbsp; I teach people the past.&nbsp; And now, along comes the best flight simulator I&#8217;ve ever seen.&nbsp; So is it better that <em>LA Noire<\/em> exists in its imperfect form than to not exist at all?&nbsp; I suppose so, since, as a young man it was beat into me that the cacotechny was part of the flux of art.&nbsp; And yet one can argue that producing something this good, this complex, with such problems, should not have been done.&nbsp; It raises too many philosophical issues, none of which I&#8217;m prepared to discuss, and likewise too many architectural issues, all of which I&#8217;m hot to discuss.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>Which, unfortunately for both of us, dear reader, I will now have to do.&nbsp; As in, I just totally Amazon&#8217;d a PS3 (whatever <em>that<\/em> may be) and a 60&#8243; flatscreen, just like they had in that there Roosevelt hotel room.&nbsp; And I have the sneaking suspicion that I&#8217;m going to spend the majority of these forthcoming lovely spring days, when a boy&#8217;s heart turns to romance, holed up in my TV room, shooting people in the face and driving an Olds up those Second Street stairs, whether they existed in real life or not.<\/p>\n<p>It begins.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>__<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Reserve to take Nathan Marsak&#8217;s free downtown&nbsp;<em>L.A.
