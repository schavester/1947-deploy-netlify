Raymond Ave.&nbsp;<\/a> They had a loaded .22 with them.&nbsp; Exactly what happened in the factory is uncertain, but little Arthur was shot twice in the head and once in the back.&nbsp; The shots didn&#8217;t kill him, though.&nbsp; Scared that Arthur would squeal on them, Paul and William beat him over the head with a brick, tied him to a pole with wire, and left him overnight.&nbsp; When they came back to the factory the next day, (to free him, they said), the boy was dead.<\/p>\n<p>Paul and William went to the police and reported that they &quot;found&quot; Arthur in the factory.&nbsp; However, the police were suspicious of the boys, and after questioning, both confessed.&nbsp; At the inquest, the two expressed little emotion or remorse for what they had done, though the truant officer sitting near them in the courtroom had them shaking in their boots.<\/p>\n<p>On December 20 hearing, Paul was joined by two lawyers, his parents, sisters, and a bevy of witnesses, while William had only his mother by his side.&nbsp; Although Paul had signed two confessions of guilt, his lawyers called witnesses to establish Paul&#8217;s alibi for the time of the killing.&nbsp; Paul also stated that he&#8217;d attended school on December 5, then rode his bicycle to a confirmation class at his church.&nbsp; The pastor of Paul&#8217;s church testified that Paul had been in class, although his schoolteacher, Miss Anna Crane, said that she had not seen Paul after 2pm on the day of the murder.<\/p>\n<p>William was sent to the Preston State School on his 15th birthday to await trial, while Paul was sent to the Whittier State School.&nbsp; Their names and school ID numbers are included in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sos.ca.gov\/archives\/indexes\/cya.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"californiayouthauthority\">California Youth Authority Name Index<\/a> for 1924 .&nbsp; However, a month after being sentenced to Ione, William produced a confession that absolved Paul of all blame in the killing.&nbsp; In his confession, William said, &quot;I pulled the gun and shot him.&nbsp; Then I though I would put the blame on someone else, so I shot him two more times.&nbsp; I happened to think that whenever Paul Daedler got mad, he always threw bricks, so I decided to throw bricks at Arthur so it would appear that Paul hit him.&quot;<\/p>\n<p>Later, it was revealed that a person interested in the case of Paul Daedler had visited him at the Preston School earlier and persuaded him to change his confession.&nbsp; The possibility that Paul&#8217;s family pressured the poor and unconnected William to take the rap for his friend is not unthinkable.&nbsp; As the boys sat in juvenile facilities, the Daedler family and their lawyers sought a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of Paul, saying that he had been confined to Whittier without a trial before a jury.<\/p>\n<p>The judge upheld Paul&#8217;s detention.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, after serving 17 months at Whittier, Paul was released into the custody of a judge, who ruled that the boy must leave the state, never to return.&nbsp; Paul&#8217;s father, Louis Daedler took him east so he could begin a new life.&nbsp; However, less than two years later, Paul was in County Jail on a vagrancy charge, having hitchhiked his way back to California.&nbsp; And today, he was returned to the juvenile facility.&nbsp; If the case did come to trial at some point, it was not reported in the Times.<\/p>\n<p>Paul Daedler died in Los Angeles on December 21, 1981.&nbsp; William Forrester was paroled from the Preston School on November 19, 1925, and disappeared without a trace. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>August 8, 1927&nbsp; Los Angeles &nbsp; &nbsp; Today, 17-year-old Paul Daedler was committed to the Preston School of Industry at Ione on vagrancy charges, and sentenced to remain there until he is 21.&nbsp; It sounds harsh, until you dig a little deeper.
