When Fullmer entered the cabin, he was bludgeoned in the head by Dr. J.H. Balzer, while Mary Wade stuck him in the arm with a hypodermic needle full of morphine.  Fullmer fought them off, and the three rolled out the cabin door where they attracted the notice of neighboring campers.<\/p>\n<p>Responding officers discovered a shovel, rope, and canvas in the cabin, and charged Balzer and Wade with suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and assault to commit murder.<\/p>\n<p>And you&#8217;ll never guess the motive for the attack.  No, seriously.  You will never guess it.<\/p>\n<p>The attack on Fullmer was the latest in a series of power plays between warring factions of a splinter sect of the Seventh Day Adventist Church.<\/p>\n<p>Fullmer had recently been excommunicated from the Seventh Day Adventist Church, along with many others, for following the teachings of Mrs. Margaret Rowan, a self-proclaimed prophet who, the Times says, &#8220;rather startled the world by predicting its sudden finish two years ago.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The excommunicated started the Seventh Day Adventist Reformed Church.  However, the fledgling church ran into trouble in a hurry.<\/p>\n<p>As President and Treasurer of the church, Fullmer found himself at odds with Rowan.  He said, &#8220;I began to suspect that maybe things weren&#8217;t just right after her prediction failed to come true&#8230; I began investigating Mrs. Rowan&#8217;s activities and the things that developed caused a split in our ranks.&#8221;  Fullmer claimed he had dirt on Rowan, and her followers intended for it never to come out.  &#8220;They were planning to kill me.  Why do you suppose they had that pick, shovel, and canvas for if it wasn&#8217;t to bury me?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In turn, Balzer claimed that Fullmer had been trying to wrest control of the group and had embezzled the church&#8217;s funds.  Balzer said, &#8220;We were driven to the limits of desperation by this man.  His persecution has been terrible.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Blessed with foresight, Mrs. Rowan skipped town right around this time, prompting a statewide search as police sought her in connection with the beating.  A week later, she surrendered to police, and stood trial with Wade and Balzer.  The three were found guilty, and sentenced to 1 to 10 at San Quentin.<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>February 28, 1927 Van Nuys, CA Today, Dr. Burt Fullmer was savagely attacked, after being lured to a cabin in the Princess Auto Camp near Van Nuys.
