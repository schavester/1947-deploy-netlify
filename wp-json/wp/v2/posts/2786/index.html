Bradbury fifty years ago and immediately famous for its grill work, goes in part to courageous elevator operator Minnie Epp, 62, of <a href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?q=123+E.+Ave.+35,+Los+Angeles,+CA&#038;hl=en\">123 E. Ave. 35,<\/a> who remained at her post to ferry firefighters up to the scene of the conflagration.

The cause of the fire is not known.<\/p>\n<p>In other news, it appears 15-year-old Esther Yvonne Brooks is going to be able to keep her nose, which was cut off when she was thrown through the windshield in an auto accident on April 21. The nose, which was missing for more than two hours, was found by Sheriff\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s deputies searching the wreckage, and rushed to Wilshire Hospital, where it was grafted back on the young lady\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s face.
