Further, he was under the care of a psychiatrist, and would remain so until the doctor deemed him sane.<\/p>\n<p>&quot;In consideration of the above,&quot; Maack read, &quot;I beg to request that I be given a suspended sentence and be permitted to forfeit my bail and that the medical staff of the Beverly Hills Health Department abstain from interfering with my case on the grounds that they are acquainted with the worst phases of my character only&#8211;&quot; (and here the statement deteriorates somewhat into possibly pixilated confusion) &quot;&#8211;and will unintentionally be acting for the good of my family than for my own good and will not be here to bother my family in the future.
