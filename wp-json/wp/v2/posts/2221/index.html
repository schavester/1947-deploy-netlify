Gunn told police he &quot;retired [<i>or passed out?<\/i>] as the guests were leaving&quot; and didn&#8217;t notice the little woman was gone until this morning. Friends didn&#8217;t know where she was, and Gunn declared there had been &quot;no quarrels or disagreements which might explain her sudden departure.&quot; There was no further mention of Mrs. Gunn in the pages of the <em>Times<\/em>, so whatever the cause of her disappearance, it probably wasn&#8217;t criminal.   <\/p>\n<p>More ominously, 14-year-old Florence Ellison left her father&#8217;s house (723 Bonnie Beach Place) yesterday afternoon to visit her mother (522 Clifton Street). Around 7:30 last night, Florence rang the doorbell at <a href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=620+South+Wilton+Place,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=34.05092,-118.20069&#038;sspn=0.063149,0.094585&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.063735,-118.314042&#038;spn=0.007892,0.011823&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The Morrison house\">620 South Wilton Place<\/a> and told C.R.

Morrison drove Florence to the streetcar, gave her directions, then returned home and called Florence&#8217;s mother. But Florence never arrived.   <\/p>\n<p><em>Epilogue<\/em>:  Florence Ellison was found, fatigued and possibly drugged, on January 2. She told police that after becoming lost, she joined the New Year&#8217;s celebrations downtown where she met cabdriver Edmund D. Kearney at about midnight. They had drinks, and after a drive through Chinatown, Florence spent the night at his apartment. Kearney was held on suspicion of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. No information was given as to just how Florence spent New Year&#8217;s Day. <\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>January 1, 1928Los Angeles A year ago prohibition agents observed that &quot;last-minute calls for holiday cheer&quot; skyrocketed on New Year&#8217;s Eve, so this year detective chief George Contreras and his men staked out area roadhouses.
