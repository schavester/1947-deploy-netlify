<p>Yesterday, Esotouric debuted the tour <strong>Raymond Chandler&#8217;s Los Angeles: In A Lonely Place</strong>, and it was a wild, psycho-geographical portrait of Chandler&#8217;s life, work and locales, and those of his alter-ego Marlowe. Here&#8217;s a little photographic sampling of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/sets/72157600210371055/">some scenes</a> along the way. </p>
<p>Tai Kim&#8217;s Bacon Caramel gelato, served up at Scoops in honor of hard-boiled meat-eating men of lore, was a revelation! Nicotine gelato was a fever dream (especially when the little kids kept gobbling sample spoons while their dad ignored them). Mint, Lime &amp; Pear Sorbet was delish. And we raffled off copies of Denise Hamilton&#8217;s new <a href="http://www.akashicbooks.com/losangelesnoir.htm" target="_blank"><em>Los Angeles Noir</em></a> anthology to three lucky passengers, courtesy of the good folks at Akashic Press.</p>
<p>Sorry you missed it? There&#8217;s a repeat on July 21, and tix are already selling, so <a target="_blank" href="http://www.esotouric.com/chandler">grab</a> yours now.&nbsp;</p>

<div>by Jacob Adelman for the Associated Press (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/487586327/" title="Photo Sharing"><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="375" border="0" src="//farm1.static.flickr.com/170/487586327_8fd5644edb.jpg" alt="Kelly at Marlowe's Office Building" /></a></p>
<p align="right"><strong>Above: Kelly Kuvo, the Blonde Dahlia</strong> &nbsp;</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES &#8212; A dismembered wannabe starlet. A girl buried under her family&#8217;s home. A rattlesnake used as a weapon.</p>
<p>The scenes of those crimes are stops on a series of Southern California bus tours that eschew the usual stars&#8217; homes and theme parks to offer passengers a peak at the region&#8217;s dark side.</p>
<p>&quot;They&#8217;re aimed at the history geek sort of people,&quot; said Kelly Kuvo, who wears a black veil and other vintage accouterments during the trips she leads for tour company Esotouric.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s &quot;crime bus&quot; tours plumb the grisly, blood-soaked pasts of now quiet Southern California neighborhoods and nondescript strip malls.</p>
<p>Similar trips elsewhere take passengers deep into cities&#8217; gory pasts, including Washington&#8217;s &quot;Bad Olde Days&quot; chronicling crime in the nation&#8217;s capital and &quot;Sinister London&quot; that follows the steps of Jack the Ripper.</p>
<p>&quot;When people die in a place, it does change that place forever,&quot; said Esotouric guide and co-founder Kim Cooper. &quot;Just because the people wandering around the neighborhood may not be aware of it, it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not a good idea for people who are interested in history to revive those memories.&quot;</p>
<p>John G. Cawelti, who writes about the seductiveness of violent crime tales in his book &quot;Mystery, Violence, and Popular Culture,&quot; said the tours play into people&#8217;s fears of death and catastrophe.</p>
<p>&quot;We live in an age where the worst kinds of things can happen to anybody,&quot; Cawelti said. &quot;Walk down the street and something blows up and all of a sudden you lost your life or lost a leg. The fact that somebody else went through this becomes a surrogate &ndash; a magical way of charming away the fear of the possibility.&quot;</p>
<p>Esotouric&#8217;s most popular tour explores 1947 Los Angeles by zeroing in on the murder of Elizabeth Short &ndash; a.k.a. &quot;Black Dahlia&quot; &ndash; who came to Hollywood in search of fame but wound up the victim of an infamous unsolved murder.</p>
<p>One stop is a ground-floor storefront on a desolate downtown street that now boasts a sign reading, &quot;Club Galaxy &ndash; 100 Beautiful Girls.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1947, when it was a bistro called &quot;The Crown Grill,&quot; it was the last place Short was seen before her dismembered body was discovered miles away in a south Los Angeles neighborhood.</p>
<p>&quot;She was friendly with the bartenders and with some of the waitresses, so people recognized her and remembered her,&quot; Cooper said. &quot;The problem of course is that everybody at the Crown Grill immediately became suspects.&quot;</p>
<p>Passengers are also introduced to lesser known crimes from the same year, such as the attempted carjacking in Hollywood of an 18-year-old movie theater cashier named Ginevra Knight, who shot her assailant dead.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s the criminal history of 1947 L.A. and how women felt going out at night in the hysteria of an unsolved murder,&quot; Cooper said.</p>
<p>The &quot;Blood and Dumplings&quot; tour through San Gabriel Valley suburbs, meanwhile, passes the home where a young bride-to-be was buried in 1969 by her uncle after he shot her to death in a jealous rage at the end of their affair.</p>
<p>It also cruises by an intersection where a man named Raymond James bought a rattlesnake he let bite his wife in 1935 so he could cash in on her insurance policy. When she didn&#8217;t die, he had an accomplice finish the job by drowning her in their fish pond.</p>
<p>Esotouric grew out of a Web log Cooper started in 2005, when she set out to retell a true-crime tale from each day of 1947. She and her collaborators soon started offering tours of those scenes and the sites of other crimes.</p>
<p>A tour that revisits the life and literature of Raymond Chandler, whose fictional characters inhabit the region&#8217;s underworld, was added to the menu of crime junkets when the company was started earlier this year.</p>
<p>Tour participant Bob Nickum, 59, a school district business manager, said seeing the sites of past crimes made him look at familiar places in a new way.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s just very interesting to drive around the area and to see things I may have passed by many times and maybe not known what happened there,&quot; said Nickum, who, like most passengers, lives in Southern California.</p>
<p>&quot;It makes things a little more interesting &ndash; vivid &ndash; to know about something that intense that took place in a calm, peaceful neighborhood,&quot; he said.</p>
