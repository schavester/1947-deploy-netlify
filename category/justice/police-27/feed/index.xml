<div>
<div align="left">February 6, 1927</div>
<div align="left"></div>
<div align="left"><img loading="lazy" title="rumsquad" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2405/2248818007_fd90e711e6_o.jpg" alt="rumsquad" width="201" height="170" align="left" border="0" /> Over the weekend, the District Attorney&#8217;s crackerjack Prohibition task force proved beyond the shadow of a doubt their devotion to the cause.</div>
<div align="left"></div>
<div align="left">Then again, after the theatrical busts they staged, it&#8217;s also possible that rum squad head George Contreras and his men simply craved adventure, danger, or an excuse to wear women&#8217;s clothing.</div>
<div align="left"></div>
<div align="left">The fun started when Contreras and two of his agents entered a home while dressed as telephone repairmen.Â  When they were unable to find the hooch inside, they flung open the chicken coop in the backyard, and were greeted by three full-grown lions.</div>
<div align="left"></div>
<div align="left">Yes, three full-grown lions.Â  <em>In a chicken coop.</em></div>
<div align="left"></div>
<div align="left">All three men promptly vaulted over the fence, and sought shelter across the street.Â  Here, they discovered A. Hernandez&#8217;s 25 gallon still, and arrested him.</div>
<div align="left"></div>
<div align="left">The lions were pets, they later discovered, though &#8220;not particularly fond of strangers.&#8221;</div>
<div align="left"></div>
<div align="left">After the lion incident, Contreras dressed two more of his agents up in women&#8217;s clothing and took them joy-riding to <a title="street" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=217+e.+61st+st.,+los+angeles,+ca&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=29.219963,59.765625&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=33.985769,-118.271427&amp;spn=0.007455,0.014591&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;om=0" target="_blank">217 E. 61st St</a>..Â  Here, he pulled up to the home of a suspected moonshiner, Raymond Manley, and asked for &#8220;some liquor for the girlfriends.&#8221;Â  When Manley brought out a bottle, police raided the place and discovered an enormous still, 180 gallons of whiskey, and 39 barrels of mash.</div>
<div align="left"></div>
<div align="left">So, to sum up:Â  a man crafts a tasty beverage by hand, and goes to jail for his trouble, while the man who raises adult lions, in a chicken coop, no less, walks free.Â  And our rum squad seems to enjoy playing dress-up a little more than the average adult probably should.</div>
<div align="left"></div>
<div align="left">Up is down, left is right.Â  Sheesh.</div>
</div>

<p>Los Angeles Police Captain W. L.

<p>Officer J.R. Reybuck had issues. Last summer, when he fought with his young wife, he thought he could resolve their troubles by choking her, snatching their baby son William, and running off to Yuma, Arizona, from which calmer perch he suggested she might join him and they could work everything out.</p>
<p>Lillian Reybuck had other ideas, and obtained a restraining order. She and her baby were living with her brother, Herbert, and mother, Mrs. Fred Hendricks at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=914+W+17th+St,+Los+Angeles,+Los+Angeles,+California+90015,+United+States&#038;sll=34.12193,-118.174396&#038;sspn=0.007745,0.013797&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;cd=1&#038;geocode=0,34.039025,-118.276495&#038;ll=34.039929,-118.276491&#038;spn=0.007752,0.013797&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">914-and-three-fourths West Seventeenth Street</a>, and that was where J.R. came today on one of his twice weekly visits. He was holding the child when he brought out his service revolver and shot his wife dead as she sat sewing in the front room. When her mother ran out of the kitchen, he took a couple of potshots at her. Mrs. Hendricks escaped out the door. </p>
<p>Reybuck unloaded a single shot through the left temple of baby William, killing him instantly. He then reloaded, leaned against the wall in front of his slain wife, and blew a hole through his brain.</p>
<p>He had blamed his mother-in-law for poisoning his wife against him.</p>

<p>July 6, 1927<br />Los Angeles&nbsp;</p>
<p>Memo to Officer Fritzler of the Los Angeles police: next time you pull a guy over at Twelth and Main because you think he&#8217;s driving drunk, don&#8217;t tell him to drive you over to headquarters so you can throw him in the pokey.</p>
<p>Oh, everything might go just find as far as the police are concerned, but when you show up in Judge Wilson&#8217;s court to defend the arrest, you&#8217;ll be roundly chastised for letting someone you believed drunk remain in his car, because&#8230; Officer&#8230; the <em>point</em> of the drunk driving laws it to get drunks <em>out</em> from behind the wheel, not to turn them into <strong><em>chauffeurs for cops!</em></strong></p>
<p>Since Fritzler clearly believed Fred Heegal was capable of driving safely through downtown traffic, and no test of drunkenness was given, the charges were dismissed, for this case and a similar one involving Officer Neff against C.A. Peterson. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Ã¢â‚¬Å“Her downfall is said to be due to a man named William Rogers, an alleged Ascot tout who deserted her,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times says. Ã¢â‚¬Å“It is charged that Miss La Doux forged the name of Mrs. John Brink on a check for $120 and cashed it.Ã¢â‚¬Â </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">La Doux told police that she and Rogers used a scheme in which she took a job with a reputable employer and passed clientsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ information to her lover. La Doux said she worked at a department store in Oakland and a dentistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s office in Los Angeles, turning over names to Rogers, who forged the checks. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ã¢â‚¬Å“She had been an honest woman, she said, until RogersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ oily tongue and smooth ways captivated her and she became his mistress and then a thief,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times says. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;" class="MsoNormal">He Paid $40</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Restaurant owner Frank Flood stood over his wife, Annie, as she lay on the floor of their quarters at a Spring Street rooming house and said it would be worth the $25 fine just so he could beat her up. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In testifying against him, Ã¢â‚¬Å“She recited a story of shocking cruelty, saying that she had been mistreated, scorned and finally beaten by the man who promised to love, cherish and protect her,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times says. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Flood did not dispute any of the charges, refused to cross-examine her (a husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right in those days) and pleaded guilty to battery. Ã¢â‚¬Å“He admitted that he struck her and confessed to having assaulted her with his fist as she lay on the floor,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times says. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He paid $40 ($837.08 USD 2005). </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Flood skipped town in September 1907. Ã¢â‚¬Å“He made the acquaintance of a fast sot and spent plenty of money, too much, in fact, for a man of his means. Late suppers at swell cafes cost Flood much cash. Then he became possessed of a desire to take long journeys in touring cars. He paid his bills with other peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s money, the new restaurant manager says, by levying on the cash drawer of the restaurant, which is owned by a company,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times says.<span style="">  </span></p>

Los Angeles</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!-- [if !supportEmptyParas]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">About 1 a.m. on a dark corner at East Adams and South San Pedro, the hard, shabby life of William Ross ended when he said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“What in hell are you fellows up to?,Ã¢â‚¬Â drew a pistol and shot plainclothes Officer C.A. May.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!-- [if !supportEmptyParas]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">May and his partner, J.M. Hoover, were walking east on Adams when they encountered Ross, described as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“rather roughly dressed man.Ã¢â‚¬Â Earlier in the evening, Hoover and May, who were working plainclothes as part of a crackdown on burglaries in the area, investigated an incident at 223 E. Jefferson Blvd., where L.C. Kelker had reported that two men were on his front porch.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!-- [if !supportEmptyParas]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The officers warned the two men to leave, but did not arrest them as there appeared to be no criminal intent, The Times says. One of the men started into the house, threatening to get a gun and Ã¢â‚¬Å“doÃ¢â‚¬Â the officers, but May and Hoover left without taking any action.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!-- [if !supportEmptyParas]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Later that evening, May and Hoover encountered Ross and suspected he might have been one of the men they encountered outside KelkerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home. May threw back his coat to reveal his badge and said: Ã¢â‚¬Å“We want to know who you are and what you are doing here at this time of night.Ã¢â‚¬Â</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!-- [if !supportEmptyParas]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ross said: Ã¢â‚¬Å“What in hell are you fellows up to? My name is Ross and I live just around the corner.Ã¢â‚¬Â Then he stepped back, drew a pistol and shot May in the shoulder or the chest.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!-- [if !supportEmptyParas]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He fired at Hoover, who ducked and shot Ross in the forehead.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Police found some papers on RossÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ body, a little money and newspaper clippings from the Herald, one about a suicide attempt by Mrs. Mary Ross of 383 or 583 Central Ave. over domestic problems and a legal notice of Mrs. Mary Ross suing William Ross for divorce.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lmharnisch.com/images/1907_0203A.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 220px; height: 199px;" src="//www.lmharnisch.com/images/1907_0203A.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">May was taken to Clara Barton Hospital, where he initially showed progress, although doctors were unable to locate the bullet.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!-- [if !supportEmptyParas]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Investigators eventually found RossÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ room at the Good Samaritan Mission, a homeless shelter at Ord Street and San Fernando near the Plaza, but there were no stolen items or any other evidence that he had been committing burglaries. Police also learned that he had been employed at one time at Pacific Carriage Works, 122 S. San Pedro.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!-- [if !supportEmptyParas]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">May was sent home to 2139Ã‚Â½ S. Los Angeles St. to recover, but the wound became infected and he returned to the hospital. Doctors were unable to locate the bullet and May died Feb. 28, 1907, with his wife and two brothers at his side.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lmharnisch.com/images/1907_0203B.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 245px; height: 526px;" src="//www.lmharnisch.com/images/1907_0203B.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Times says he Ã¢â‚¬Å“expressed remorse that it had been necessary for the officers to shoot the man, but he said it was a case of kill or be killed.Ã¢â‚¬Â</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!-- [if !supportEmptyParas]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As a National Guard member and a veteran who had served in the Philippines during the Spanish-American War, May was given military honors in a funeral at Pierce Bros. Mortuary at Flower and 8<sup>th</sup> Street. A funeral procession consisting of police officers and National Guard troops escorted his casket to 1<sup>st</sup> Street and Spring, where they boarded streetcars for the interment at Evergreen Cemetery.</p>

<p>He was met at the house by a woman who insisted the dog was quite friendly and most quiet.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo; said the woman, who opened the door&hellip;and with one bound the pooch leapt upon the patrolman, tearing his coat sleeve and trouser leg.&nbsp; When Sanders drew his revolver, the fearless canine took the muzzle in his mouth and began a protracted game of tug o&rsquo; war with the interloper.</p>
<p>Sanders kicked the dog away, and the woman gathered the pup up in her arms and bore him away, weeping hysterically, crying &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you fired from the force you brute!&rdquo;&nbsp; To which the tattered Sanders replied &ldquo;Go ahead&mdash;do anything but please don&rsquo;t let that dog out again!&rdquo;</p>
