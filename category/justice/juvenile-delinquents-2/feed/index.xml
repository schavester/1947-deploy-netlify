Gardena</p>
<p>The Artful Dodger would have been nothing without his teacher, Fagin, but the Dare-Devil Club of Gardena didn&#8217;t need anybody to train them in the techniques of thieveryÃ¢â‚¬â€they did it themselves. Indeed, the cops called their social club a &#8220;crime school.&#8221; Today, on the cusp of the club&#8217;s first &#8220;graduation,&#8221; police arrested five of its officers, all between the ages of 10 and 14. The charges? Burglary. The enterprising young criminals first broke into the Gardena schoolhouse. They also plagued Gardena resident T. Tsuchiyare, breaking into his house on three separate occasions and stealing his Kodak camera, jewelry, even the money from his children&#8217;s piggybanks. The boys are scheduled to appear before Judge Archibald next week. Further arrests are expected before then. </p></div>
