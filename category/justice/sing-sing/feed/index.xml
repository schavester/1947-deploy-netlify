<p>December 17, 1927 <br />Ossining, NY <img loading="lazy" title="Ruth Snyder" height="229" alt="Ruth Snyder" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2029/2118859314_1e2b88168a_m.jpg" width="240" align="right" border="0" /></p>
<p>Mrs. Ruth Snyder has a date with Sing Sing&rsquo;s electric chair on January 12, 1928, unless her plea for executive clemency is granted. </p>
<p>The seductive blonde and her lover, corset salesman Judd Gray (see photo), were both tried and convicted of murdering Ruth&rsquo;s husband by caving in his skull with a window sash weight, strangling him with a garrote fashioned out of picture wire and a gold pen, and finally stuffing chloroform soaked rags into his nostrils. </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="Judd Gray" height="240" alt="Judd Gray" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2407/2118796958_ebb380e852_m.jpg" width="175" align="left" border="0" />If there is an explanation for the obvious overkill in the murder of Albert Snyder, it must be that Ruth&rsquo;s previous attempts to snuff out the life of her husband (twice by asphyxiation and once by poison) had failed &ndash; and she wasn&rsquo;t about to give up. Ruth had persuaded her husband to take out a double indemnity policy, which would pay&nbsp;her in the event of his accidental death. It was the lure of the $97,000 worth of life insurance that compelled her to continue with her diabolical schemes until she succeeded. </p>
<p>Fueled by two bottles of whiskey and profound stupidity, the criminally-challenged duo staged the murder scene as a burglary gone horribly wrong. But their pathetic plan was doomed to failure. They threw an Italian language newspaper on the floor as a false clue to the identity of the killers. They emptied dresser drawers and overturned chairs. And in an act that would eventually help prosecutors to prove her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, Ruth hid her allegedly stolen jewelry under her mattress, about three feet away from Albert&rsquo;s battered body! </p>
<p>The trial of Ruth and Judd would be a media circus, and celebrities such as director D.W. Griffith, and evangelists Billy Sunday and Aimee Semple McPherson would attend. Ruth would be called &ldquo;ruthless Ruth&rdquo;, &ldquo;vampire&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;blonde fiend&rdquo; by the press. Evidently not all men found those appellations a turn-off, because Ruth received at least 160 marriage proposals during her incarceration. <img loading="lazy" title="DEAD" height="312" alt="DEAD" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2268/2118797280_b48c64d100_o.jpg" width="217" align="right" border="0" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately for Ruth, her plea for clemency would be denied by Governor Al Smith. Her execution would be famously recorded by newspaper man Tom Howard. The ingenious reporter had strapped a miniature <a title="ankle camera" href="http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object.cfm?key=35&#038;objkey=160" target="_blank">camera</a> to his ankle beneath his trousers. Just as the executioner threw the switch on the whimpering murderess, Tom raised the cuff of his pants and snapped the tabloid photo of a lifetime. </p>
<p>The murderers were unexceptional, but their crime inspired art. <a title="Machinal" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machinal" target="_blank">&ldquo;Machinal&rdquo;,</a> a play by Sophie Treadwell was deemed one of the best of 1928-29. <a title="James M Cain" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_M_Cain" target="_blank">James M. Cain&rsquo;s</a> brilliant novels &ldquo;Double Indemnity&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Postman Always Rings Twice&rdquo; are said to have been inspired by Albert Snyder&rsquo;s murder. And, of course, each of the novels translated into two of the finest examples of film noir ever produced. </p>
