<p>
March 3, 1927<br />
Los Angeles
</p>
<p>
&quot;Who can take a sunrise,<br />
Sprinkle it with dew,<br />
Cover it in chocolate and a miracle or two?<br />
The candyman, the candyman can,<br />
The candyman can &#8217;cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good.&quot;
</p>
<p>
When local school children crave a hand full of gum drops and a pint of whiskey, where can they go? Rumor has it that if they visit Frank BelioiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s candy store at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=5973+South+Broadway,+Los+Angeles,+CA&amp;sll=34.010835,-118.231087&amp;sspn=0.016862,0.046778&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=33.986534,-118.278315&amp;spn=0.008433,0.023389&amp;t=h&amp;z=16" target="_blank" title="5973 South Broadway">5973 South Broadway</a>, they may leave with a few new cavities and a major buzz.
</p>
<p>
Sgt. Childers was in charge of the squad that raided the local sweets shop, and revealed in court that although the police department had reports that Frank was selling liquor to minors, they had failed to produce evidence against him.
</p>
<p>
Frank was lucky Ã¢â‚¬“ the only thing the cops managed to bust him for was the one and one-half gallons of whiskey on the premises. He said he kept it on hand for party guests.
</p>
<p>
Frank pleaded guilty to the possession charge, and Judge Ambrose fined the candy man $300 [$3,639.31 current USD].
</p>
<p>
I could go for a pint of gin and a chocolate bar right about now. Are you with me?

<p>The fourth in a series of bold daylight robberies of outlying classrooms has been reported at the Lillian School, near <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=Holmes+and+Slauson+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+CA,+USA&#038;sll=33.99511,-118.230314&#038;sspn=0.026187,0.054159&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=33.990715,-118.241172&#038;spn=0.006547,0.01354&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=0" target="_blank">Holmes and Slauson Avenues</a>. As a room full of terrorized seven-year-olds covered their ears and quaked, a tall, very slender negro relieved their teacher, Mrs. Ruth Hanna, of her handbag, which contained $20 cash. His weapon was neither gun nor knife, but his horrifying facility with curse words and threats. The criminal is suspected to be one William Tyler, known to police as &quot;Stealing 24&quot; and &quot;The Apple Box Kid.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in darkest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Hollywood,_Los_Angeles,_California" target="_blank">Lankershim</a>, Isabel Suaze, 15, is in hiding after hearing her parents&#8217; plans for the family to return to their former home in Arizona. The girl is such a California booster, she&#8217;d rather become a street urchin than leave L.A. Here&#8217;s to a most discerning young lady!</div>

<p>Today, after the usual morning argument in their <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=531+Westminster+Ave,+Alhambra,+CA+91803&#038;sll=34.088457,-118.156285&#038;sspn=0.008672,0.01399&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.088457,-118.156285&#038;spn=0.008672,0.01399&#038;z=16&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="thelovenest">Alhambra home</a>, George announced he&rsquo;d had his fill, and moved his stuff out to go shack up with&hellip;a <em>widow</em>.&nbsp; Tonight Mabel followed George to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=335+W+42nd+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90037&#038;sll=34.007529,-118.279273&#038;sspn=0.001085,0.001749&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.008185,-118.279281&#038;spn=0.00868,0.01399&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="salyerhome">335+1/2 West 42nd Street</a>, where George was involved with one Mrs. Helen Salyer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Along for the ride Mabel had taken her old friend the pistol.</p>
<p>In fairness, Mabel did, on the sidewalk in front of Helen Salyer&rsquo;s house, give George one last chance, asking him to come back to her.&nbsp; George approached and said, firmly, no.&nbsp; With that, Mabel shot him in the stomach; the force of the blast turned him around and Mabel shot him again in the back.&nbsp; Mabel walked back to her car, got in, and sat calmly there until authorities arrived. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is a woman ever really sorry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(With no defense offered other than the &ldquo;unwritten law,&rdquo; on May 19 she was ordered held to Superior Court for trial by Municipal Judge Rosencranz on charges of assault with intent to commit murder.&nbsp; She told the court &ldquo;I shot him because I loved him&rdquo; and reiterated &ldquo;sure I shot him&mdash;if I couldn&rsquo;t live with him I wasn&rsquo;t going let anyone else live with him.&rdquo;&nbsp; The jury, out an hour, gave her a full acquittal on May 24.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="body">
<div>January 10, 1927<br />Unincorporated Los Angeles</p>
<p>Sheriff&#8217;s officers responded to a desperate cry of murder after a corpse was found by oil field workers digging ditches in Brea, but when they investigated they determined it was merely the aged skeleton of an Indian, disinterred from his ancient grave. The corpse was reburied without ceremony, and the diggers advised to avoid the spot in the future.</p>
<p>And in another Sheriff&#8217;s case with a fresher body, the peculiar suicide by gun of Charles Norton, shopkeeper at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=1760+East+Slauson,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=34.09816,-118.28956&#038;sspn=0.00741,0.014205&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=33.990484,-118.307905&#038;spn=0.007419,0.014205&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">1760 East Slauson</a>, was explained away rather ingeniously. Why was the man found dead in his bed in the store&#8217;s back room, when his brother said he had no reason to do away with himself? Deputy Sheriff Hackett believes the cause was a nightmare, triggered by the story &quot;Shooting Mad&quot; in the Wild West-themed magazine lying beside the dead man. Hackett suggests Norton dozed off while reading, dreamed a gunman was in the room, reached under the pillow for his own weapon and inadvertently shot himself. Stranger things have happened in Los Angeles.</div>

<p>January 3, 1927<br />South Los Angeles</p>
<p>The men came marching onto County land, with their boots and their buckets and their shovels and their poles, and the ladies of <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=east+71st+street+and+hooper,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=56.375557,98.085938&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=33.976152,-118.251134&#038;spn=0.003648,0.005987&#038;t=h&#038;z=17&#038;om=1&#038;layer=c&#038;cbll=33.976855,-118.252072" target="_blank">East 71st Street</a>, just east of Hooper Avenue, came out of their little bungalows, leaving their babies and their breakfast dishes and their washboards and their bougainvilleas, and they met there, in the middle of the road, and looked each other up and down. </p>
<p>&quot;Why have you come to our little street?&quot; asked the ladies.<br />&quot;To install high tension electrical wires,&quot; the men replied.<br />&quot;Down the middle of our street?&quot;<br />&quot;Down the middle of your street.&quot;<br />&quot;Like hell you will!&quot; was the ladies&#8217; retort. And when the workmen returned to sink their poles on Monday morning, they found an angry mob of females who congregated around the various spots where holes were to be sunk and planted their bodies in the way of any work. One octogenarian brought a chair out and sat atop the digging spot, while others stood their ground and glared. At lunch time, other women came out and changed places, so no child would go without its meal.</p>
<p>The men retreated, not willing to spill female blood or risk their own safety further. On further investigation, it was revealed the city has not obtained the proper county permit to plant any such power line down 71st Street, so any such erection would be delayed indefinitely. And the next day, a spokesman for the work crew said, &quot;They not only won, they routed us altogether. There&#8217;ll be six feet of ice at Sixth and Broadway before some of our men venture on Seventy-first street again. We ceased operations because we are not putting up any poles or lines on any street where the people object to them. Nothing will be done unless we can come to some agreement with the women.&quot;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to the heroines of the Battle of East 71st Street: Mrs. P. R. Bottomly of 1348 East 71st Street, Mrs. H. B. Dawson of #1332, Mrs. M. M. Schnell of #1342 and Mrs. W.J. Kline of #1315 and those who sat for the photograph (L-R): Mrs. Louisa H. Orr (aged 82), Mrs. W. A. Grubbs, Mrs. G. S. McIntyre (provisional general), Mrs. M. Robertson (aide-de-camp), Mrs. R. Jackson (chief of staff) and Mrs. Louise Dixson. For sisterhood is powerful, NIMBYism is nothing new in Los Angeles, and who the hell wants power lines cluttering up their view?</p>

<p>Was it murder?&nbsp; Some folks thought so.&nbsp; In addition to charges for arson and destroying insured property, Ferlin was charged with the murder of Walter Skala, despite the fact that he wished him no harm and was over a mile away at the time Skala sustained his injuries.&nbsp; The charge was issued under an old and little-used California statute that held a person who conspired to commit an unlawful act responsible if another person was indirectly killed as a result of that crime.</p>
<p>At Ferlin&#8217;s trial, the judge instructed the jury to deliberate only on the two lesser charges and acquit on murder.&nbsp; However, the jury ignored him roundly, saying they felt Ferlin was &quot;morally guilty&quot; in Skala&#8217;s death and convicted him of murder.&nbsp; Of course, there were appeals at the District and State level that dragged on for over two years while Ferlin sat in prison.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there was trouble at home.&nbsp; Ferlin&#8217;s wife, Jean, and her lover, Ivan Hunsacker, appeared in juvenile court on charges of contributing to the delinquency of two minors, Jean&#8217;s children.&nbsp; Apparently, since Ferlin was locked away, Hunsacker had been shacking up with Jean and the kiddies.&nbsp; The couple pled guilty to the charges.</p>
<p>In March 1927, the State Supreme Court announced that Ferlin&#8217;s appeal would be heard, along with three other notorious murder cases.&nbsp; Faithful 1947project readers will be interested to know that Earl J. Clark, aka the <a href="/redrosekiller" target="_blank" title="redrosekiller">Red Rose Killer</a>, was alongside Ferlin on the docket.&nbsp; Clark would hang at San Quentin later in the year, but things went better for our arsonist.</p>
<p>Today, the court ruled that Ferlin was entitled to a new trial on the murder charge since the jury had disregarded the instructions of the trial judge.&nbsp; Ferlin&#8217;s sentence of 25 years for his other convictions was upheld.&nbsp; The murder beef was eventually dismissed in 1928.</div>

<div>June 1, 1927<br /> West Adams  </p>
<p>For some time now Francis Grierson, better known in San Diego as Jesse Shepard, has been quietly living at the  boarding house of a Hungarian benefactress who had taken in the aged author, spiritualist and improvisational musician and his longtime friend and secretary Lawrence Waldemar Tonner and was forgiving about their inability to pay the rent. Such is so often the fate for one like Grierson, who all his life fought Materialism despite great creative success.</p>
<p> Several days ago, Grierson had just completed one of his extraordinary piano performances, during which he channeled the creative energies of deceased musical geniuses and presented previously unheard compositions from beyond. As the music ceased, Grierson became very still, as was his habit&#8230; but after a long moment, his audience grew restless, and Tonner went to the piano to shake his friend. Grierson was dead, aged 79, most probably from heart disease exacerbated by malnutrition.</p>
<p> As a self-taught child musical prodigy he was the toast of Europe, a friend of Whitman and Verlaine, praised by Dumas <em>p&eacute;re</em> and by Kings and Czars. Of his four-octave voice, the poet Stephane Mallarm&eacute; marveled, &quot;It is not a voice, it is a choir!&quot;</p>
<p> He claimed to be a silent partner to Madame Blavatsky in the founding of the Theosophical Society. His books (<em>Modern Mysticism, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1417903805/ref=nosim/bubblegumbook%20" target="_blank">The Valley of the Shadows</a></em>) were best sellers, and in San Diego, the High Brothers built a fabulous home for him, the <a href="http://www.hauntedhouses.com/states/ca/villa_montezuma.cfm" target="_blank">Villa Montezuma</a>, in a vain hope that we would stay and sprinkle his spiritualist stardust over their sleepy burg. </p>
<p> But time moved for him, as it must for all of us, and in recent years he made a bit of a fool of himself, lecturing on &quot;The Secret of Eternal Youth&quot; with his lips and cheeks painted crimson, a toupee on top and a very obviously dyed moustache. </p>
<p> Just last week Grierson took a break from working on his new book of verse and pawned a gold watch given him by King Edward VII. But it wasn&#8217;t enough. Tonner went to the Assistance League begging support for the once celebrated man, and they were willing, but the aid came too late. Now they will take over his funeral arrangements, and ensure his disposal is a fitting one.</p>
<p> Francis Grierson (1848-1927) lies in state at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=Washington+Blvd+and+figueroa,+Los+Angeles,+California&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=55.937499,101.425781&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.035911,-118.271835&#038;spn=0.007237,0.012381&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">Pierce Brothers</a>, Washington and Figueroa. Won&#8217;t you go and pay your respects to one who flew so high and fell so far, before he is cremated tomorrow? </p>

<p>May 11, 1927<br />Los Angeles </p>
<p>Most liquor raids are tedious affairs, a pack of lit-up salesmen here, a couple sobbing college boys there. But once in a while, officers make a raid that&#8217;s just kind of special. </p>
<p>One such operation was on a blind pig at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=3120+South+Main+Street,+la,+ca&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=58.99189,105.644531&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.022147,-118.271255&#038;spn=0.007647,0.012896&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">3120 South Main Street</a>, allegedly run by Mrs. Ocio Walsh. Mrs. Walsh was taken into custody on charges of possession of liquor and contributing to the delinquency of a minor, while 38-year-old Frank Jones was charged with drunkenness and Robert Maschold, 37, with vagrancy.</p>
<p>That delinquency charge? See, Mrs. Walsh has a 14-year-old daughter, Mary Zella. Great kid, really <em>responsible</em>. When Sgt. Kynetto and Officers Wolf and Pound busted in they found a scantily-clad Mary Zella pouring a bottle of hooch down the sink. Mama sent her up to dress, the the clever minx hopped out a second story window and skedaddled. </p>
<p>Where&#8217;s she gone? Maybe back to the convent, from which Mama recently removed her to help out with the family business. Like I said, great kid.</p>
