<p>Though the papers reported Alois Sabinski&#8217;s recent battle with chloroform in his Nicholas Street home, California Hotel lessee Ellen Lincoln declared she&#8217;d heard nothing about any â€œchloroform burglar;â€ Fullerton Chief of Police T.

<p>Yeah, she threw herself into the part.&nbsp; She could throw a mean left cross too, apparently.&nbsp; In fact she went so nuts she broke several straw hats and mussed up the hair of several spectators and managed to bust the nose, teeth, and blacken the eye of some ponce named Basil Webb.</p>
<p>She is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0781293/bio" target="_blank" title="eileen">Eileen Sedgwick</a>, and she was portraying an excited Swedish servant girl, cheering the home town team in Metro&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0018413/#comment" target="_blank" title="SKS"><em>Slide, Kelly, Slide</em></a>.&nbsp; And now she stands shoulder to shoulder to shoulder with Metro and the United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company, as Basil bemoans his condition before Referee Crowell of the State Industrial Accident Commission.</p>
<p>We are beguiled by the fetching Ms. Sedgwick!&nbsp; Mr. Webb should consider himself lucky to have be walloped by so charming a creature.</p>

<p>Angelenos had a rough time on the road today&mdash;Miss Rachel Miller was struck by Joseph J. Reuter as she crossed the 2600 block of Pico, suffering a fractured skull, concussion of the brain, a broken knee and leg; Henry Van De Kamp was struck by I. Tomioka at East Second and <img loading="lazy" width="125" height="228" border="0" align="left" title="harlanpic" alt="harlanpic" src="//farm1.static.flickr.com/196/466758485_55cabea944_o.gif" />Central, fractured skull, concussion of the brain; J. L. Perrine, who admitted his brakes were &ldquo;not so good,&rdquo; drove into and off of a 400-foot embankment on Effie in the Moreno Highlands, multiple abrasions; four motorists walked away when the front half of their auto was flattened by the Los Angeles Railway car at First and Hill; and one Miss Mollie Reesor miraculously suffered only black eyes and a nasal fracture after being hurled twenty-five feet by a hit-and-run at the corner of Washington Street and Harvard Boulevard.</p>
<p>Most notable, naturally, was the pedestrian-killing of Mrs. Eleanor Bishop, fatally injured when run down by prolific film star <a title="harlan" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0363218/">Kenneth Harlan</a>, of 810 Camden Drive.&nbsp; Harlan, on his way to a benefit at the Alexandria, stated<img loading="lazy" width="222" height="223" border="0" align="right" title="harlanprevost" alt="harlanprevost" src="//farm1.static.flickr.com/216/466785757_e0726055b6_o.gif" /> that the woman stepped from behind a parked car near Wilshire and Tremaine.&nbsp; After he struck Bishop, he drove her to the office of Dr. James Johnston at Sixth and Western, where she nonetheless expired.&nbsp; Assuming Harlan still had time to make the benefit, his day looked like <a title="harlandrives" target="_blank" href="http://maps.yahoo.com/;_ylc=X3oDMTExNmIycG51BF9TAzI3MTYxNDkEc2VjA2ZwLWJ1dHRvbgRzbGsDbGluaw--#mvt=m&#038;gid4=30109647&#038;q4=201+West+FIfth+Street%2C+Los+Angeles%2C+CA&#038;q3=Sixth+Street+at+Western+Avenue%2C+Los+Angeles%2C+CA&#038;q2=Wilshire+Boulevard+at+Tremaine+Avenue%2C+Los+Angeles%2C+CA&#038;q1=810+N+CAMDEN+DR%2C+Beverly+Hills%2C+CA%2C+90210&#038;trf=0&#038;lon=-118.332195&#038;lat=34.063752&#038;mag=6">this</a>.</p>

<div align="left"><img loading="lazy" width="293" height="500" border="0" align="left" src="//farm1.static.flickr.com/170/463229798_ebefb7aeba.jpg" alt="johngilbert" title="johngilbert" />John Gilbert, celebrated film star and sometimes paramour of Greta Garbo entered lock-up today with a sheepish grin on his face.&nbsp; Gilbert was arrested for disturbing the peace early on April 11 when he appeared at the Beverly Hill Police Station after a party at his home, demanding that someone be arrested.&nbsp; Who exactly, he wouldn&#8217;t say.&nbsp; When police explained they could not make an arrest without a name, Gilbert became so boisterous that he was jailed until morning.</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">&quot;I must have been laboring under a hallucination and looking for trouble,&quot; Gilbert said of his behavior.&nbsp; &quot;I wasn&#8217;t angry at any of my guests and I just went down to the station and the boys took care of me; very kind to me.&quot;</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">Gilbert was sentenced to 10 days in jail, which he said, &quot;ought to be a nice, quiet vacation.&quot;</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">Could there have been trouble with Mauritz Stiller, Gilbert&#8217;s main rival for Garbo&#8217;s attentions?&nbsp; Too much sauce?&nbsp; Or just a celeb behaving badly?&nbsp; It&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess &#8211; Gilbert kept mum on the cause of his outburst.</div>
