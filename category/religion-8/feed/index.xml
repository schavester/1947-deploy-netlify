<p>(Our evangelical docs Steen &amp; Steen will make the papers again in March, charged of malpractice by one Mary A.

<p>Miss Grace Shannon, national secretary of our own YWCA, has just returned from Turkey, and good news:&nbsp; there&rsquo;s no Dumb Doras there!&nbsp; Sure, it&rsquo;s all right for a man to have four wives (&ldquo;to which every good Mussulman says &lsquo;Amen,&rsquo;&rdquo; chuckles Ms. Shannon), but the crafty gals there under Atat&uuml;rk (we say atagirl!) have found some loophole that goes on to contradict such (referring to the famous Koranic<em> Koran 4:3/Koran 4:129 Paradox</em>).&nbsp; Yes, it seems the <a title="ataboy" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Kemal_Atat%C3%BCrk">new republic</a>&rsquo;s progressive divorce laws and campaigns for women&rsquo;s sufferage have made it a veritable heaven on earth for the gentler gender. &nbsp;</p>

<p>September 4, 1927<br />Los Angeles  </p>
<p>The public stenographer was used to all sorts of crazy jobs, but the one that arrived in the mail last week was a new one for sure. She was to type up, and send to a number of prominent citizens, an appeal for $1500 from a purportedly destitute woman who promised to kill herself if the money was not received by the following Wednesday. The letter was signed &ldquo;Madame XYZ.&rdquo; It was all too weird for the stenographer, who turned the request over to police.  </p>
<p>Today, an anonymous note showed up at the <a title="L.A. Central Police Station, 1938" target="_blank" href="https://jpg2.lapl.org/pics04/00011777.jpg">Central Police Station</a> identifying Madame XYZ as Eunice McMullin of <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=2674+South+Vermont+Avenue,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=29.219963,59.765625&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.03159,-118.291533&#038;spn=0.007451,0.014591&#038;z=16&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="Madame XYZ's house">2674 South Vermont Avenue</a>. Clues given in the note led detectives to the conclusion that McMullin is really Mrs. Frank A. Martin. The 40-year-old Mrs. Martin has been missing since last week, according to her husband, who also said she tried to kill herself three years ago in Oakland.   </p>
<p>XYZ/McMullin/Martin was clearly no criminal mastermind; the note, which used her real address, also included details of a railroad accident Martin suffered in 1913. And asking a public stenographer to send her extortion letters? Pure bush league.   </p>
<p><em>Postscript</em>:  Police closed the case the following day, after the still-missing Madame XYZ contacted her husband and promised not to take her own life. Detectives noted that Mr. Martin was &ldquo;not at all concerned&rdquo; over his wife&rsquo;s threats of suicide (an attitude apparently shared by the LAPD where Madame XYZ&rsquo;s attempt at blackmail was concerned).   </p>
<p>His wife wanted the money, Mr. Martin revealed to the <em>Times</em>, to &ldquo;establish a new religious movement.&rdquo; Neighbors, on the other hand, reported that they hadn&rsquo;t noticed an upsurge in religious activities by either of the Martins, who were &ldquo;in a strained financial condition&rdquo;&mdash;or so said the neighborhood busybodies.  </p>
<p>The story ended two days later, when Madame XYZ dropped a letter in her husband&rsquo;s mailbox stating she would return to him only if he joined her in founding her sect. Alas, no details were given concerning the new religion, and, as police reiterated, given Mr. Martin&rsquo;s &ldquo;confidence that no harm will befall his wife,&rdquo; the case was at a standstill.  </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Someone who opened the Los Angeles Times on this Sunday might be forgiven for wondering what had become of the world, for Page 1 was full of news about the demise of two religious leaders. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The first was the death of John Alexander Dowie, the founder of Zion, Ill., who considered himself the reincarnation of the biblical prophet Elijah. The second was the decline of Mary Baker Eddy, founder of Christian Science. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Times published some of EddyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s letters to her son, saying: Ã¢â‚¬Å“These Eddy letters, now carefully guarded in a safe deposit vault at Washington, are confidently expected to invalidate every transaction made by Mrs. Eddy in the last 15 years.Ã¢â‚¬Â</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">They are too long to post, but hereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a sample: </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ã¢â‚¬Å“My Dear Son: The enemy to Christian Science is led by the wickedest powers of hypnotism and is trying to do me all the harm possible by acting on the minds of people to make them lie about me and my family.Ã¢â‚¬Â </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">DowieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history is far more complex and even the highlights of his career defy an easy summary. He arrived in San Francisco in 1888 and moved to<span style="">  </span>Chicago two years later. By 1899 he was mobbed by thugs while staging nightly crusades in Chicago after establishing a divine healing mission and opening a bank and newspaper.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In 1900, he bought the property for what is now Zion and began calling himself Ã¢â‚¬Å“Elijah the Restorer.Ã¢â‚¬Â </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Five years later, he was paralyzed in Zion upon returning from a trip to begin a colony in Mexico. In 1906, he appointed a general overseer, Wilbur Glenn Voliva, who took over the movement and repudiated him. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">DowieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last words were: Ã¢â‚¬Å“The millennium has come. I will return in a thousand years.Ã¢â‚¬Â </p>

Los Angeles  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Since his teens, James Lauer has been studying the Bible. Where others have struggled to parse its meanings, he has found clarity. He wants to write a book that will explain it all. The only thing he needs is $1,000 ($20,523.57 USD 2005). </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">During his studies of the Bible, Lauer has apparently never encountered anything prohibiting extortion, so to get the money, he has been writing notes to Mrs. Joseph Maier Sr. One was not enough, so Lauer wrote a series of letters demanding money and threatening her life if she didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t pay. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At the moment, Lauer is in the City Jail under examination by Dr. Quint. Neither LauerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conduct nor his appearance is reassuring. Ã¢â‚¬Å“His long red hair and beard are unkempt, his flat-topped skull is peculiarly formed and his painfully strained gaze does not indicate a well-balanced mind,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times says.<span style="">  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""> </span>Ã¢â‚¬Å“During his imprisonment in the City Jail, Lauer talked wildly of his plans for writing a book about the Bible which would clear up all the<span style="">  </span>misunderstanding. He repeatedly declared that while all attempts to explain the Bible have failed, it is quite clear to him, and that he could explain it perfectly to others if he were given opportunity to write his book.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lauer, according to his own statement, has pored over the Bible constantly since he was 15 years of age, inventing explanations, and this, it is believed, has turned his brain.Ã¢â‚¬Â </p>
