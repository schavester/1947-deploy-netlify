March 17, 1927<br />
Bakersfield
</p>
<p>
Frustrated at being rejected for employment as a nurse by Kern Hospital, twenty-one year old Gladys Maryon Lindley came up with a plan Ã¢â‚¬“ become a man!
</p>
<p>
Dressed in menÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clothing and answering to the name Ã¢â‚¬Å“BillyÃ¢â‚¬Â, Gladys presented herself at Kern Hospital once again. Instead of seeking employment as a nurse, Ã¢â‚¬Å“BillyÃ¢â‚¬Â applied for the job of a male orderly this time and was hired on the spot.
</p>
<p>
Gladys went undetected until three months later, when the secret of her identity was revealed by one of her former teachers. Recognizing Ã¢â‚¬Å“BillyÃ¢â‚¬Â at the hospital, the teacher ratted her out to hospital administrators. Gladys &#8211; aka Billy &#8211; resigned immediately.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps naively, the LA Times reported that Ã¢â‚¬Å“a real desire to do hospital work was given as the explanation of the masqueradeÃ¢â‚¬Â.

<p>
March 10, 1927 <br />
Bellflower
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2373/2322213913_405c780863.jpg" border="0" alt="baby farm headline" width="500" height="131" />
</p>
<p>
Police received a tip that next to the home of Ray Foss in Bellflower, several people had been observed burying something that may have been the body of an infant. Thankfully, no bodies would be found. Police had discovered however, that Ray had an outstanding felony warrant from 1925 for operating a &quot;baby farm&quot; in Moneta (near Gardena). The fear of being nailed on the baby farm charge loosened his tongue, and Ray Foss began to relate a sordid tale of baby trafficking, illegal adoption, an alimony racket, bigamy, and narcotics addiction.
</p>
<p>
Ray told the cops that a woman being held in County Jail on forgery charges under the name of Minnie Williams was actually his wife, and that she had been the proprietress of the Moneta baby farm.
</p>
<p>
The baby farm had come to the attention of the authorities in 1925 when Minnie sold a baby girl to a woman who gave her name as Mrs. Johnson. The infant was found to be blind, and Mrs. Johnson returned the child and demanded a refund. The child later died. Mrs. Foss gave the woman $25 in cash, and in lieu of the remaining $35, she gave her another baby! Ray and Minnie fled a short time later to avoid standing trial.
</p>
<p>
During the next two years Minnie trafficked in babies, ran an alimony racket, and fed her drug addiction. She provided infants for women to carry into court when seeking alimony. Prior to being identified as Minnie Foss, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d tried a variation of the alimony con in Judge HardyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s court. Using the Williams alias, she made an emotional plea for probation on the forgery charge, alleging that she was about to become a mother. The court soon discovered that she was not actually Minnie Williams, and that she was wanted in the Moneta baby farm case. With the masquerade over, Mrs. Foss began to confess to Deputy District Attorney Costello.
</p>
<p>
Things got off to a strange start when Minnie was asked to state her name for the record. She told the Deputy DA that her last name was really Hines, not Foss. She said that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d married Ray Foss when she was only 15 years old, and then met Clarence Hines in 1921. The three lived together in a <em>mÃƒÂ©nage a trois</em> until Foss left. Minnie claimed that she then married Clarence, but never went to the trouble or expense of divorcing Ray.
</p>
<p>
How did Minnie end up trafficking in babies? According to her, she was in fact, a &quot;serial adopter&quot;. In 1922 she had noticed a newspaper ad about adopting a baby. She said that she went to the Mexican quarter near the Plaza and met with a couple who told her that they had a child they couldn&#8217;t keep. Minnie took the baby home and passed him off to Clarence as his own child. She told him that the child had been born to her while she was away in Burbank!
</p>
<p>
Clarence may have been a very dim bulb, because over the next few years Minnie said that she brought home several other infants including a set of twins, and that she had informed him that he was the father! According to Minnie, Clarence never questioned her about any of the babies, so she continued to adopt.
</p>
<p>
Maybe Clarence wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quite as gullible as Minnie had thought, however. When questioned by police, Clarence told a slightly different story. He said that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d known that his wife sometimes placed Ã¢â‚¬Å“not wantedÃ¢â‚¬Â babies. He also told investigators that he was aware of a black trunk which may have been used to store baby clothes or as a coffin for some of the unwanted babies. The trunk was later found at a home near Bakersfield that had once been occupied by Ray Foss.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="//farm4.static.flickr.com/3032/2322214053_52281b109e.jpg" border="0" alt="baby farm trunk" width="428" height="500" />
</p>
<p>
When the trunk was examined by police it was found to contain baby clothes, a hypodermic needle, and a marriage license issued to Ray Foss and Minnie Magnolia Williams. Also found in the trunk were approximately twenty-four photographs of young girls and babies.
</p>
<p>
Even though Minnie said that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d adopted the infants, the most likely scenario was that she occasionally kept unwanted babies born to women in her care. Where did all of the babies go? Police traced many of the children to foster parents who subsequently adopted them. Several infants remained unaccounted for.
</p>
<p>
Although there were many unanswered questions Ã¢â‚¬“ particularly regarding the fates of the infants who could not be found, Deputy DA Costello dropped the baby farm charges because Minnie and Clarence had confessed everything to his satisfaction Ã¢â‚¬“ including an addiction to narcotics for which Minnie was treated with Narcosan. The DAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s office couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t pursue the bigamy charges because the statute of limitations had run out.
</p>
<p>
Minnie pleaded guilty to issuing a fraudulent check and was given a sentence of from one to fourteen years in prison. Clarence received a similar sentence.

March 3, 1927<br />
Los Angeles
</p>
<p>
&quot;Who can take a sunrise,<br />
Sprinkle it with dew,<br />
Cover it in chocolate and a miracle or two?<br />
The candyman, the candyman can,<br />
The candyman can &#8217;cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good.&quot;
</p>
<p>
When local school children crave a hand full of gum drops and a pint of whiskey, where can they go? Rumor has it that if they visit Frank BelioiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s candy store at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=5973+South+Broadway,+Los+Angeles,+CA&amp;sll=34.010835,-118.231087&amp;sspn=0.016862,0.046778&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=33.986534,-118.278315&amp;spn=0.008433,0.023389&amp;t=h&amp;z=16" target="_blank" title="5973 South Broadway">5973 South Broadway</a>, they may leave with a few new cavities and a major buzz.
</p>
<p>
Sgt. Childers was in charge of the squad that raided the local sweets shop, and revealed in court that although the police department had reports that Frank was selling liquor to minors, they had failed to produce evidence against him.
</p>
<p>
Frank was lucky Ã¢â‚¬“ the only thing the cops managed to bust him for was the one and one-half gallons of whiskey on the premises. He said he kept it on hand for party guests.
</p>
<p>
Frank pleaded guilty to the possession charge, and Judge Ambrose fined the candy man $300 [$3,639.31 current USD].
</p>
<p>
I could go for a pint of gin and a chocolate bar right about now. Are you with me?

<p>February 18, 1927 <br />Whittier </p>
<p>The Whittier social set was agog at the forcible bobbing of Mrs. Evelyn Thompson&rsquo;s hair by two of her former friends, Mrs.&nbsp;Florence Nutt&nbsp;and Mrs.&nbsp;Lucille Roulston. </p>
<p>All three young women had married men in the local oil business. The couples had become friends who frequently partied together. At a recent dance,&nbsp;Lucille believed that Evelyn had spent too much time in the arms of her husband, and in a fit of jealousy she plotted her revenge. </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="Bobbed Hair Babes" height="320" alt="Bobbed Hair Babes" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2091/2275555284_7a2b5539d0.jpg" width="500" border="0" /></p>
<p>The bobbing incident unfolded like this: Evelyn had been out shopping for stockings, and as she passed by Roulston&rsquo;s home she was flagged down and invited inside to see Lucille&rsquo;s new hat. </p>
<p>Once inside the house, Evelyn decided to try on her new stockings. She was seated in a chair with one of her shoes off when she heard a snip and saw four of her curls fall to the floor. It was at this point that Florence held her down while the scissors wielding&nbsp;Lucille hacked off the rest of Evelyn&rsquo;s curls, snarling &ldquo;You used to be the center of attraction, but no man will ever look at you now.&rdquo; Evelyn told police &ldquo;It was over almost before I knew what was happening. I started fighting them without avail.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Prior to the forced shearing, Evelyn had sported lovely long chestnut curls &ndash; they were her crowing glory. She said &ldquo;I had never wanted to be a flapper. That&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t bob my hair.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Florence&nbsp;Nutt was arrested and charged with mayhem. A warrant had to be&nbsp;issued for the arrest of Mrs. Roulston, because she&rsquo;d taken it on the <a title="lam" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/lam" target="_blank">lam</a>. She was sighted in places as far flung as the Orient! </p>
<p>The mayhem charges would be dismissed, thus ending the criminal case. Evelyn had the option to seek damages in civil court if she wanted, but there would be no further mention of the bobbers or bobbee in the LA Times. </p>

<p>February 11, 1927 <br />Los Angeles </p>
<p>Valentine&rsquo;s Day is coming up and most couples will celebrate their love with cutesy cards, candy, and maybe some pre-prohibition champagne.<img loading="lazy" title="Margaret" height="193" alt="Margaret" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2146/2256400616_5d821169c1_o.jpg" width="105" align="right" border="0" /> Mr. and Mrs. Hugh Fillmore will not be among the celebrants. Margaret Fillmore has filed for a divorce. Their love has turned as cold as a stone floor. </p>
<p>Margaret had said that she was annoyed by Hugh&rsquo;s refusal to give her money, and by his arrogant attitude. But she may have been willing to overlook everything if it hadn&rsquo;t been for the stone tile. </p>
<p>In her divorce papers Margaret claimed that Hugh had bankrupted her by insisting that she use tile, manufactured by his company, in the home they were building (and she was financing). Margaret claimed that all of her money had gone into the construction of the house, and that the additional $2000 [$24,142.07 current USD] that it cost for the custom tile had left her destitute. </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="Hugh" height="188" alt="Hugh" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2203/2256400594_fc8ea41bd0_o.jpg" width="102" align="left" border="0" />Hugh was thinking only of the advertising potential of having the tile in his home, especially since his sister-in-law was the actress <a title="Mary Miles Minter" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Miles_Minter" target="_blank">Mary Miles Minter</a>. Perhaps Mary would bring some of her Hollywood cronies over to see the tile. She still had lots of friends in town, even though she had featured prominently in the 1922 mysterious, and still unsolved, slaying of director <a title="William Desmond Taylor" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Desmond_Taylor" target="_blank">William Desmond Taylor</a>. </p>
<p>Margaret is having none of it &ndash; she&rsquo;s determined to end her marriage. All she wants now is a divorce and an inexpensive carpet. Sadly, the road to true love is often a rocky (or stony) one. </p>

<p>February 4, 1927 <br />Los Angeles </p>
<p>A police dragnet is closing in on the killers of Luther H. Green.&nbsp; A&nbsp;member of the Los Angeles Stock Exchange, Green was slain outside of his home at <a title="1053 Bonnie Brae" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=1053+south+bonnie+brae,+la,+ca&#038;sll=34.042345,-118.266076&#038;sspn=0.000942,0.001824&#038;layer=&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;om=1&#038;ll=34.060481,-118.27692&#038;spn=0.083621,0.152607&#038;z=13" target="_blank">1053 Bonnie Brae</a>, as he attempted to thwart the hijacking of his $10,000 [$120,710.34 current dollars] stash of pre-prohibition booze. He was able to fire a single shot from his rifle before being mortally wounded by the burglers. </p>
<p>According to Chief of Detectives Cline, six men have been implicated in the aborted liquor heist. It is believed that the ringleader of the failed raid may be the notorious crook, <a title="Mile Away Thomas" href="http://www.47upgradepath7.richardschave.com//node?from=315" target="_blank">Harry &ldquo;Mile-Away&rdquo; Thomas</a>. Mile-Away&rsquo;s mouthpiece, Attorney S.S. Hahn, told cops that he had conferred with his client and, &ldquo;&hellip;he was not only a <em>mile</em> away this time, but <em>sixteen</em> miles away&rdquo;. Harry and several of his confederates would soon be arrested in connection with Green&rsquo;s murder, but none of them would ever stand trial for the crime. </p>
<p>More than a decade prior to the invention of <a title="Teflon" href="http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blteflon.htm" target="_blank">Teflon</a> &reg;, the often busted but rarely convicted non-stick felon would be released on the charges stemming from the Green killing. His lucky streak would end on the evening of April 21, 1927. Harry would be caught in a sting and gunned down by the law as he attempted to steal an expensive automobile from a private garage at <a title="1408 W 35th St" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=1408+W+35th+St,+Los+Angeles,+Los+Angeles,+California+90026,+United+States&#038;sll=34.077332,-118.262393&#038;sspn=0.022287,0.039353&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.025205,-118.296747&#038;spn=0.022301,0.039353&#038;z=15&#038;om=0" target="_blank">1408 West Thirty-Fifth Street</a>. </p>
<p>Riddled with machine-gun bullets, buckshot, and slugs from police revolvers, Harry staggered from the garage and collapsed in the arms of a uniformed officer. Mile-Away&rsquo;s last words before he succumbed to his injuries were &ldquo;Everybody has to fall some time.&rdquo; </p>

<p>January 28, 1927 <br />Los Angeles </p>
<p>The hunt is on for a cop killer. Traffic Officer Parley Bennett was mortally wounded when he attempted to halt a robbery at Brodin Millinery Company. Bennett was attempting to pull out his revolver when he was shot by the bandit. His weapon discharged as he fell, but fortunately no one was injured by the stray slug. Officer Bennett was dead before he hit the floor. </p>
<p>Services for the slain officer would be held at the Brown Brothers Las Flores Chapel, <a title="935 W. Washington" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=935+West+Washington+St,+Los+Angeles,+Ca&#038;sll=34.146334,-118.185768&#038;sspn=0.037222,0.093555&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.03744,-118.2781&#038;spn=0.009317,0.023389&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=0" target="_blank">935 West Washington Street</a>, and he would be interred at <a title="Evergreen Cemetery" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=Evergreen+Cemetery,+Los+Angeles,+Ca&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.053299,-118.233833&#038;spn=0.037263,0.093555&#038;z=14&#038;om=0" target="_blank">Evergreen Cemetery</a>. </p>
<p>Parley&rsquo;s widow, Elizabeth, received $1,000 [$12,071.03 USD 2007]&nbsp;worth of police insurance, and merchants on Los Angeles Street (where Bennett died) passed the hat and collected a total of $1,071 for the bereaved woman. </p>
<p>While the fallen officer was being mourned, more that 150 policemen searched in vain for his slayer. Chief of Detectives Cline stated that the search for Parley&rsquo;s killer would continue indefinitely. </p>
<p>Although 250 suspects would be taken in for questioning, none of them would be positively identified by witnesses to the shooting. There would be the usual sightings of men answering the description of the desperado, but each suspect would ultimately be released. Eventually the leads would dry up, and Officer Bennett&rsquo;s murder would remain unsolved. </p>

<p>January 21, 1927 <br />Los Angeles </p>
<p>Edward W. Xanders (aka Bert Best) was extradited from Portland, Oregon today to be tried for a series of robberies and burglaries committed in Los Angeles over the Christmas holidays. </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="Lindley mansion" height="192" alt="Lindley mansion" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2323/2209865978_0af5c5d525_m.jpg" width="240" align="left" border="0" />Xanders spent most of the day with sheriffs, trading quips and calmly confessing to a litany of misdeeds. He admitted to burglarizing the home of John Lindley near Azusa (see photo), and he has also said that he and his crime buddy, Ray E. McCoy, robbed famed boxing manager <a title="Jack Kearns" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Kearns" target="_blank">Jack Kearns</a>. </p>
<p>It was through his confession that police learned that Xanders and McCoy had stopped Kearns&rsquo; car on a lonely road near the beach. While the stick-up was in progress, a policeman had approached the car to see if the men needed assistance. McCoy jabbed a gun into Kearns&rsquo; ribs and told him to keep quiet, or die. Always the glib talker, Xanders chatted with the cop, offered him a cigar, and sent him on his way. </p>
<p>Xanders admitted to police that he had been in court a few times during 1926. He stated that he had been granted probation on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon. It was during that case that he had told the court that a childhood head injury had led him to a life of crime. According to his story, ever since he had received the blow to his noggin, he has had an irresistible urge to commit crime. Based on an alienist&rsquo;s report, the judge recommended that Xanders, if willing, should undergo an operation to relieve pressure on his brain. Xanders declined to have the surgery. </p>
<p>With the nasty pressure still on his brain, it wasn&rsquo;t long before Xanders was in court again. In making his plea for probation, he said that he&rsquo;d been offered employment for two years on a ship headed for the South Seas. The judge felt compassion for the youthful crook and gave him four years of probation, on the condition that he would accept the job and sail off into the sunset (and out of this jurisdiction) for at least two years. Of course Edward never boarded the ship; he stayed in Los Angeles and continued his crime spree. </p>
<p>Edward is still a young man, and his penchant for crime may easily lead to another crack on the cranium. Maybe a second smack upside the head will put him on the straight and narrow. </p>

<p>January 14, 1927 <br />Taft </p>
<p>Hut, two, three, four &ndash; an army of field mice is on the march in <a title="Taft, CA" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=taft,+CA&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=35.14247,-119.45743&#038;spn=2.811783,5.037231&#038;z=8&#038;om=1" target="_blank">Taft</a>, and like most armies, this one travels on its stomach. </p>
<p>Despite being low on the food chain, or maybe because of it, field mice are crafty little creatures, and they can rapidly assess a situation before taking action. While cutting a wide swath through Taft, the mouse invaders spied a small sheep that was confined in a pen and unable to escape. Hundreds of rodent soldiers felt their mousedar vibrate. They swarmed the helpless animal and devoured it on the spot. </p>
<p>Not all mice are evil sheep snacking marauders. On November 18, 1928, <a title="Walt Disney" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney" target="_blank">Walt Disney</a> would introduce an adorable animated <a title="Mickey Mouse" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Mouse" target="_blank">anthropomorphic mouse</a> in the cartoon, <a title="Steamboat Willie" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steamboat_Willie" target="_blank">&ldquo;Steamboat Willie&rdquo;.</a> Nobody would ever look at a mouse in quite the same way. </p>

<p>January 7, 1927<br />Los Angeles </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="Death Potion Headline" height="240" alt="Death Potion Headline" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2268/2175835654_b34cdaf937_m.jpg" width="197" border="0" /></p>
<p>Bending the Volstead Act to the breaking point is <em>de rigeur</em> among the smart set, with an evening of drinking rarely resulting in anything worse than a queasy stomach and a screaming headache the next day. </p>
<p>Dennis J. Cavanaugh (22) and his companions Walter Scott and &ldquo;Tex&rdquo; Scott went out last night to do a little carousing. The young men began their evening by stopping off to buy a couple of pints of rum at a store on&nbsp;East Ninety-Second Street, run by the Henkins brothers, Clay (46) and William (48). </p>
<p>Where the young men went to party after purchasing the hooch is not known, but by this morning Walter was in critical condition at his home, &ldquo;Tex&rdquo; was very ill, and Dennis had been found dead on the front lawn of a house at <a title="1847 Roosevelt Street" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=1647+Roosevelt,+Los+Angeles,+Ca&#038;sll=33.953346,-118.242288&#038;sspn=0.009327,0.023389&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.043148,-118.301382&#038;spn=0.009317,0.023389&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">1847 Roosevelt Street</a> &ndash; his body reeking of alcohol. </p>
<p>Whether they knew it or not, the Henkins brothers had sold the boys poison liquor. They are currently in jail facing manslaughter charges. </p>
<p>Buying illegal booze is dangerous &ndash; it&rsquo;s like playing <a title="Russian roulette" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_roulette" target="_blank">Russian roulette</a>. But it becomes even more frightening when people like <a title="Wayne B. Wheeler" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Wheeler" target="_blank">Wayne B. Wheeler</a>, advocate of the <a title="Anti-Saloon League" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Saloon_League" target="_blank">Anti-Saloon League</a>, come out in support of allowing the government to use poison to enforce Prohibition. </p>
<p>On January 1st of this year, the new government formula (&ldquo;Formula No. 5&rdquo;) for denaturing industrial ethyl alcohol went into effect. The formula doubles the amount of poison which manufacturers are required to use. Bootleggers sometimes buy industrial ethyl alcohol and substitute the original label with one of their own. Only three drinks of the libation may cause permanent blindness. </p>
<p>Many in Congress have demanded that the government stop legalized murder. The Secretary of the Treasury recently announced that he is opposed to the use of poison to enforce the law, but that &ldquo;Formula No. 5&rdquo; will remain until a non-removable, non-poisonous denaturant can be found by government chemists. </p>
