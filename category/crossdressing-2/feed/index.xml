<p>At the turn of the century. Eltinge became well known for his parodies of iconic female figures like the Gibson Girl (his was the &quot;Simpson Girl&quot;), and was lauded as &quot;the most fascinating woman on the American stage.&quot;&nbsp; In 1910, he opened <em><img loading="lazy" width="222" height="300" border="0" align="right" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1239/1442772795_f20585441f_o.jpg" alt="eltinge2" title="eltinge2" />The Fascinating Widow</em>, a musical comedy where he played both male and female roles, the latter of which would become his signature role.&nbsp; Eltinge was a hit, marketing his own line of magazines featuring beauty tips, as well as a line of cosmetics.&nbsp; Ads for his cold cream read, &quot;See what the Julian Eltinge cold cream does for a man.&nbsp; Imagine what it will do for a woman.&quot;</p>
<p>Eltinge enjoyed a fairly successful career in silent film, though his weight, age, and reported alcohol abuse made it difficult for him to continue to play an ingenue.&nbsp; Additionally, Hollywood laws that made it illegal for a man to perform in women&#8217;s clothing reduced his act to singing in a tuxedo while pointing at a rack of dresses.</p>
<p>Throughout his life, he vehemently denied rumors that he was a homosexual, saying, &quot;I am not gay.&nbsp; I just like pearls.&quot;</p>
<p>More information on his fascinating life can be found at <a href="http://www.thejulianeltingeproject.com/" target="_blank" title="julianetingeproject">The Julian Eltinge Project</a>.</div>

<p>March 29, 1927<br />Los Angeles&nbsp;</p>
<p>Busted in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=exposition+park,+los+angeles&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=56.462693,109.160156&#038;layer=&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=15&#038;ll=34.0161,-118.286448&#038;spn=0.01462,0.040727&#038;om=1&#038;iwloc=addr" target="_blank">Exposition Park</a> on a vagrancy charge after aggressively flirting with passing fillies, licensed chauffeur (read: cabby) Jerry McFarlane was dumped in the men&#8217;s tank at the Central Jail, where fellow inmates quickly noticed what booking officers had not: trash-talkin&#8217; &quot;Jerry&quot; was actually Grace Kenny McFarlane, 22, blonde and biologically female.</p>
<p>She was promptly pulled from the cell and plopped in front of an <em>L.A. Times</em> photog, who snapped a pair of mirror image pix highlighting the two sides of fair McFarlane, and a reporter whose all-too-brief interview revealed the unique philosophy of the Jazz Age youth. </p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s much more fun to be a man. Besides, I get along better, too, and the life is freer and easier.&quot; Except, of course, when it lands one in the pokey. &quot;I wish I could get out and get back with the gang. I was going to take a frail out the night I was arrested. It&#8217;s lots of fun to take a girl to a dance or a show and not have them get wise.&quot; And even more fun, we&#8217;d wager, when they do.</p>
