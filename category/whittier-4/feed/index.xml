<p>April 22, 1927<br />Whittier</p>
<p>The 1924 Rentz-Rentz-Weible love triangle ended as love triangles so often do&mdash;with a corpse.&nbsp; When Henry Rentz, 23, got a mysterious call at the Whittier Piggly Wiggly to get himself <a href="http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&#038;ss=yp.alcatraz&#038;cp=pnwkvg54xfqw&#038;style=o&#038;lvl=1&#038;tilt=-90&#038;dir=0&#038;alt=-1000&#038;scene=6486048&#038;sp=Point.pnwkvb54xfqt_Friends%20Ave%20%26%20Penn%20St%2C%20Whittier%2C%20CA%2090602%2C%20United%20States___&#038;encType=1" target="_blank" title="rentzhome">home</a>, he found Mrs. Rentz, 21, in bed with 18 year-old oil worker Louis Weible.&nbsp; As such, Rentz shot Weible in the stomach.&nbsp; The judge declared that<img loading="lazy" width="238" height="300" border="0" align="right" src="//farm1.static.flickr.com/198/469397257_4325dd0287_o.gif" alt="rentzfamily" title="rentzfamily" /> Rentz &ldquo;fired to protect the sanctity of his home&rdquo; and exonerated the murderer.&nbsp; The Rentz&rsquo; put the past aside and settled back into domestic bliss.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Rentz&rsquo; repentance was short-lived.&nbsp; The Rentz&rsquo; were in court again yesterday, this time for divorce proceedings, and for the second time Henry had to relate the story of Louis Weible&rsquo;s slaying.&nbsp; Seems Myrtle Rentz, the little minx, had had a letter in her apron pocket:&nbsp; &ldquo;Baby, I&rsquo;ll see you at noon, bye-bye, love.&nbsp; Your Love Prof.&rdquo; This was found by and was too much for Henry; he filed for divorce in short order.&nbsp; He got it in shorter order, up to and including custody of their daughter. &nbsp;</p>

<p>July 31, 1907<br /> Whittier&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the pleadings of well-situated friends, Eugene Parks, Junior is bound to face a Superior Court judge and answer to the charge of attempted theft of nearly a whole wagonload of lemons from the Whittier Citrus Association&#8217;s railway siding. Parks and his pal Kirchner were caught in the act by Superintendent Greeley of the State School, and all the lemons were saved.</p>
<p> In court today, the youngsters begged the judge to accept as an extenuating circumstance the fact that they were looped to the gills on strong beer, half a dozen bottles a piece, and to recognize that they were at heart honest boys from good homes. But he would have none of it. For if a little beer would make thieves of them, then thieves they were, and only a higher court could determine an appropriate punishment. </p>
