<p>UPDATE: 12/22 has sold out, 12/29 tour was added and sold out within a day&#8230; but you can still get on the waiting lists!</p>
<p>Gentle reader,</p>
<p>We are giddy to announce that our Christmas week tour will be a very special event: &quot;James Ellroy Digs L.A.&quot;</p>
<p>Our host on the tour will be the acclaimed crime novelist and memoirist whose highly personal take on L.A.&#8217;s underworld from the 1940s through the 1960s is as captivating as it&#8217;s horrifying.</p>
<p>Passengers will gather on Saturday 12/22 at Arnie Morton&#8217;s downtown (which is opening specially for our group at noon, with a limited snack and bar menu), then get on the bus at 1pm sharp for James Ellroy&#8217;s personal guided tour through the city that haunts his dreams and inspires his art. <br />&nbsp;<br />We&#8217;ll accompany the author on an uncensored time travel journey to tony Hancock Park, where he stalked his teenage classmates and later broke into houses. . . to the Hollywood flats to explore some of the heinous 1950s murder cases that fascinated him as a youth and continue to feed his obsessions. . . and out to El Monte, where his mother Geneva was murdered, the unsolved crime that runs through all his work, from &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot; to &quot;My Dark Places.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />When asked what passengers could expect on this tour, James Ellroy said, &quot;I dig L.A. because I&#8217;m from here. My parents hatched me in a cool locale. I&#8217;m desperate to impress people, I&#8217;m a good talker, I know a shitload about L.A. and I want to share it. On this tour, you&#8217;ll get L.A. crime and social history on an unparalleled AND intimate scale.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />So get on the bus at Arnie Morton&#8217;s in downtown LA on December 22 and spend your holidays with the demon dog of American literature, on what&#8217;s sure to be the coolest ticket in town. </p>
<p>Tickets are $60/person, available from <a href="http://www.esotouric.com/ellroy" target="_blank">http://www.esotouric.com/ellroy</a> or by <a href="http://www.47upgradepath7.richardschave.com//feedback" target="_self">emailing</a> to reserve and then sending a check. Seats are extremely limited on this special event tour; and sorry, no discounts or Esotouric season pass tickets will be honored.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Upcoming Esotouric bus tour schedule:<br /></strong>Sat Nov 17&nbsp; &ndash; Pasadena Confidential tour<br />Sat Dec 8 &#8211; Raymond Chandler&#8217;s LA<br />Sat Dec 15 &#8211; James M. Cain&#8217;s So California Nightmare<br />Sat Dec 22 &ndash; James Ellroy Digs L.A. <br />Sun Jan 15 &#8211; Vroman&#8217;s edition, The Real Black Dahlia<br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gentle reader,</p>
<p>What are you doing Saturday afternoon? Will you be among the lucky citizens exploring the strange secrets of the San Gabriel Valley and feasting on juicy dumplings on a concrete sea monster, or will you bored and kicking yourself for not getting on the Crime Bus? Read on for all you need to know to avoid that sad fate.<br />&nbsp;<br />For this Saturday, September 29, Esotouric&#8217;s Crime Bus offers a rare edition of its wackiest true crime and history tour, Blood &amp; Dumplings. Tickets for the four-to-five hour luxury coach tour, including dumplings, are $60. Heading due East out of downtown for points rarely seen, the tour explores several historic communities that reflect the growth and eccentricity that are hallmarks of 20th century Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Crime Bus passengers will be treated to detailed descriptions of some of the most notorious, strange and fascinating forgotten tales from the past hundred years, each told at the scene of the crime. They&#8217;ll thrill to the freakish case of the Man from Mars Bandit who stalked area supermarkets for months in 1951 before meeting his match in a police sharpshooter, shock to discover the deadly infighting among El Monte&#8217;s American Nazi Party members, mourn the Case of the Buried Bride dragged beneath her home on her wedding day by her secret lover, gnash teeth at the weird lion farm (home to every MGM lion) that served lion meat barbecues on special occasions, and visit scenes of notorious cases including Phil Spector&#8217;s spooky hilltop castle, James Ellroy&#8217;s murder victim mother Geneva (the true-life inspiration for his Black Dahlia novel), neglected Manson victim Steve Parent and even an obscure East LA link to the JFK assassination.<br />&nbsp;<br />And since no visit to the San Gabriel Valley is complete without a delicious Chinese meal, the Crime Bus will stop at 101 Noodle Express (one of Jonathan Gold&#8217;s picks for 99 L.A. restaurants not to be missed) to pick up a dumpling feast, which will be enjoyed picnic-style at Monster Park, a remarkable sea-themed folk art environment recently saved from demolition. There passengers can enjoy their snack in the mouth of a concrete whale, or under a grinning octopus, then pose for photos with the creatures. </p>
<p>All this, plus stunning mid-century trailer parks, subterranean Black Panther hideouts, wild shootouts, dope-dealing druggists, missing Salvador Dali paintings, the original&nbsp; &quot;little girl down a well&quot; television sensation, and a very strange story about ducks.</p>
<p>This tour is my personal favorite of all our tours, packed with more offbeat history, horror, roadside architecture and fabulous Route 66 vistas than any other. We don&#8217;t offer it very often, and I highly recommend it to anyone who has been thinking about getting on the Crime Bus.</p>
<p>And don&#8217;t forget, we offer 15% discounts for KCRW members, gift certificates, and Season Pass deals ($30 off four tours for one person) that can be applied retroactively for recent passengers. </p>
<p>For more info on Esotouric, or to reserve your seat, visit<br /><a href="http://www.esotouric.com/" target="_blank">http://www.esotouric.com/</a> <br />&nbsp;<br />Upcoming Esotouric bus tour schedule:<br />Sat Sept 29 &ndash; Blood &amp; Dumplings (San Gabriel Valley true crime tour)<br />Sun Oct 7&ndash; Reyner Banham Loves Los Angeles (architecture/urbanism tour)<br />Sat Oct 20&ndash; The Real Black Dahlia tour<br />Sun Oct 21 &ndash; Where the Action Was (rock history tour)<br />Sat Oct 27 &ndash; Haunts of a Dirty Old Man: Charles Bukowski&#8217;s LA<br />Sun Oct 28 &ndash; Hallowe&#8217;en Horrors featuring Crimebo the Clown</p>

<p>Gentle rider,  </p>
<p>The Crime Bus Tour will ride again in September and October, and while final details are still being worked out before we can begin selling tickets, we are accepting pre-reservations to make it easier for interested passengers to fit us into their schedules. </p>
<p>Note that our regular 5 hour Crime Bus tours cost $47, but it is possible that the Dahlia tour will be both shorter and less expensive. </p>
<p>The upcoming tours are as follows:  </p>
<p>1) The Real Black Dahlia, Saturday 9/16 and perhaps also Sunday 9/17 (to coincide with opening weekend of the Black Dahlia film), in which we will visit many of the places Elizabeth Short actually frequented during her time in Los Angeles, including the spot where her body was found. The tour also includes scenes familiar from many of the weird theories surrounding her death, and a presentation by myself and Nathan on Dr. Walter Bayley, the only viable suspect ever proposed by a crime researcher, our 1947project colleague Larry Harnisch. </p>
<p>2) Halloween Horrors, Saturday 10/21, our darkest tour yet, featuring the most horrible, weird and disturbing stories uncovered in our researches. This tour is not recommended for children or the faint of heart, and you might want to bring your own barf bag. </p>
<p>If interested in either tour, please <a href="http://www.47upgradepath7.richardschave.com//feedback" target="_blank">email me</a> with your name, phone number, and number of tickets desired. For the Dahlia tour, note if you can attend Saturday, Sunday or either. This does not obligate you to buy tickets, but you&#8217;ll get first crack at them when they are available. If it&#8217;s the Pasadena Confidential tour you wish to ride, let me know, as it will give us an idea of the demand and help determine when to schedule the next run.</p>
