<p>December 17, 1927 <br />Ossining, NY <img loading="lazy" title="Ruth Snyder" height="229" alt="Ruth Snyder" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2029/2118859314_1e2b88168a_m.jpg" width="240" align="right" border="0" /></p>
<p>Mrs. Ruth Snyder has a date with Sing Sing&rsquo;s electric chair on January 12, 1928, unless her plea for executive clemency is granted. </p>
<p>The seductive blonde and her lover, corset salesman Judd Gray (see photo), were both tried and convicted of murdering Ruth&rsquo;s husband by caving in his skull with a window sash weight, strangling him with a garrote fashioned out of picture wire and a gold pen, and finally stuffing chloroform soaked rags into his nostrils. </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="Judd Gray" height="240" alt="Judd Gray" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2407/2118796958_ebb380e852_m.jpg" width="175" align="left" border="0" />If there is an explanation for the obvious overkill in the murder of Albert Snyder, it must be that Ruth&rsquo;s previous attempts to snuff out the life of her husband (twice by asphyxiation and once by poison) had failed &ndash; and she wasn&rsquo;t about to give up. Ruth had persuaded her husband to take out a double indemnity policy, which would pay&nbsp;her in the event of his accidental death. It was the lure of the $97,000 worth of life insurance that compelled her to continue with her diabolical schemes until she succeeded. </p>
<p>Fueled by two bottles of whiskey and profound stupidity, the criminally-challenged duo staged the murder scene as a burglary gone horribly wrong. But their pathetic plan was doomed to failure. They threw an Italian language newspaper on the floor as a false clue to the identity of the killers. They emptied dresser drawers and overturned chairs. And in an act that would eventually help prosecutors to prove her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, Ruth hid her allegedly stolen jewelry under her mattress, about three feet away from Albert&rsquo;s battered body! </p>
<p>The trial of Ruth and Judd would be a media circus, and celebrities such as director D.W. Griffith, and evangelists Billy Sunday and Aimee Semple McPherson would attend. Ruth would be called &ldquo;ruthless Ruth&rdquo;, &ldquo;vampire&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;blonde fiend&rdquo; by the press. Evidently not all men found those appellations a turn-off, because Ruth received at least 160 marriage proposals during her incarceration. <img loading="lazy" title="DEAD" height="312" alt="DEAD" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2268/2118797280_b48c64d100_o.jpg" width="217" align="right" border="0" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately for Ruth, her plea for clemency would be denied by Governor Al Smith. Her execution would be famously recorded by newspaper man Tom Howard. The ingenious reporter had strapped a miniature <a title="ankle camera" href="https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object.cfm?key=35&#038;objkey=160" target="_blank">camera</a> to his ankle beneath his trousers. Just as the executioner threw the switch on the whimpering murderess, Tom raised the cuff of his pants and snapped the tabloid photo of a lifetime. </p>
<p>The murderers were unexceptional, but their crime inspired art. <a title="Machinal" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machinal" target="_blank">&ldquo;Machinal&rdquo;,</a> a play by Sophie Treadwell was deemed one of the best of 1928-29. <a title="James M Cain" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_M_Cain" target="_blank">James M. Cain&rsquo;s</a> brilliant novels &ldquo;Double Indemnity&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Postman Always Rings Twice&rdquo; are said to have been inspired by Albert Snyder&rsquo;s murder. And, of course, each of the novels translated into two of the finest examples of film noir ever produced. </p>

<p>And boy, was he right.&nbsp; Who can forget the terrible collapsings of Berg &amp; Clark&rsquo;s <a title="gillender" target="_blank" href="https://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/fnart/fa267/19th/nyc_gillender.jpg">Gillender Building</a>, or Burnham &amp; Root&rsquo;s <a title="ashlandblock" target="_blank" href="https://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/fnart/fa267/19th/ashland_block.jpg">Ashland Block</a> or <a title="chicagomasonic" target="_blank" href="https://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/fnart/fa267/19th/chicago_masonic.jpg">Masonic Temple</a>, or Flagg&rsquo;s <a title="singerbldng" target="_blank" href="https://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/fnart/fa267/20th/singer2.jpg">Singer Building</a>, et al?&nbsp; Damn that atmospheric penetration!&nbsp; (For more on victims of atmospheric penetration, go <a title="oopstheyfelldown" target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc-architecture.com/GON/GON.htm">here</a>.) </p>
<p>Here in Los Angeles of the future, of course, the atmosphere laughs as it burns paint and mud and water right off our tall buildings.&nbsp; But stand tall and proud still, <a title="sunsetvine" target="_blank" href="https://www.you-are-here.com/los_angeles/sunset_vine.html">they do</a>!</p>

Gordon Whitehead, a McGill University student.&nbsp; Bess Houdini would receive a settlement of $25,000 ($296,962 USD 2007).</div>
<div align="left">Of course, New York Life had good reason to be confused.&nbsp; Even today, Houdini&#8217;s death is surrounded by uncertainty.&nbsp; Some accounts say that Whitehead challenged Houdini to take the punch fair and square, while others claim that he and his buddies lambasted the illusionist while he reclined on a sofa.&nbsp; According to some, the blow to the abdomen could have ruptured Houdini&#8217;s appendix, while others today say that this would only have aggravated a pre-existing condition.&nbsp; Still others speculate that he was actually poisoned by the angry Spiritualists he&#8217;d discredited.&nbsp; As recently as March of this year, Harry&#8217;s descendents were seeking to have the body exhumed, while Bess&#8217;s sought to block it, claiming that the whole thing reeked of a book promotion stunt.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s a humble claims adjuster to do?</p></div>
