<p>December 22, 1927<br />Los Angeles</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put up our feet and see what&rsquo;s gone on in the world this day.&nbsp; Not much.&nbsp; The odd curiosity or two.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><img loading="lazy" width="249" height="195" border="0" align="right" title="hemp" alt="hemp" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2197/2131536350_30713e4032_o.jpg" /><br />According to our concerned friends at the paper, it seems the Mexicans are making a menace of themselves, using flowers of the &ldquo;hemp&rdquo; plant as some sort of habit-forming drug (they&rsquo;re such a resourceful people!).&nbsp; Apparently the Imperial Linen Products Company has blanketed the Imperial Valley with the stuff.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;m sure the <a title="nexttheredcar" target="_blank" href="http://www.world-mysteries.com/marijuana1.htm">State</a> will sort this one out to everybody&rsquo;s satisfaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="253" height="200" border="0" align="left" title="onelastcig" alt="onelastcig" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2236/2131536354_cd46111e8d_o.jpg" />Oh dear, here&rsquo;s <a title="kaboom" target="_blank" href="https://pensive-torvalds-020d34.netlify.app/?p=2189">another</a> fellow who just couldn&rsquo;t resist a final cigarette.&nbsp; Seems J. B. Smith left the wife at his <a title="jbsHouse" target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=420+west+maple,+glendale,+ca&#038;sll=34.291509,-118.432102&#038;sspn=0.016062,0.029182&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.138662,-118.261557&#038;spn=0.008045,0.014591&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1">Glendale home</a> and checked into the LaViolette Hotel on <a title="kablooie" target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=N+Maclay+Ave,+San+Fernando,+Los+Angeles,+California,+United+States&#038;sll=34.28393,-118.43869&#038;sspn=0.008031,0.014591&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;cd=1&#038;geocode=0,34.290020,-118.432120&#038;ll=34.291509,-118.432102&#038;spn=0.016062,0.029182&#038;z=15&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1">North Maclay</a> in San Fernando.&nbsp; He brought with him a stack of goodbye letters indicating his fears about going mad, and a loaf of bread&mdash;not for snacking, but for soaking in water and wadding into the wafty windows and drafty doors (my hat off again to the resourcefulness of our Southlanders).&nbsp; Of course, no-one banks on the dang&rsquo;d jets taking so <em>long</em>.&nbsp; Thankfully J. B. also brought along a pack of <a title="ifyagotem" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIN8MmMloZE">smokes</a> to pass the time&hellip;the hole blown in the wall was six feet in diameter.&nbsp; J. B.&#8217;s smoldering remains lived long enough to say goodbye to his wife at the hospital, but not much longer than that.</p>

<p>And what do have we here&hellip;a Coroner&rsquo;s inquest will be held at 1:30 today to determine whether Ralph McCoy, in City Jail on suspicion of robbery, actually hung himself in his cell or was killed by fellow prisoners&mdash;it seems McCoy bears (well, bore) a resemblance to one <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/10605329@N07/" target="_blank" title="WEH">William Edward Hickman</a>.</p>

<p>December 17, 1927 <br />Ossining, NY <img loading="lazy" title="Ruth Snyder" height="229" alt="Ruth Snyder" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2029/2118859314_1e2b88168a_m.jpg" width="240" align="right" border="0" /></p>
<p>Mrs. Ruth Snyder has a date with Sing Sing&rsquo;s electric chair on January 12, 1928, unless her plea for executive clemency is granted. </p>
<p>The seductive blonde and her lover, corset salesman Judd Gray (see photo), were both tried and convicted of murdering Ruth&rsquo;s husband by caving in his skull with a window sash weight, strangling him with a garrote fashioned out of picture wire and a gold pen, and finally stuffing chloroform soaked rags into his nostrils. </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="Judd Gray" height="240" alt="Judd Gray" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2407/2118796958_ebb380e852_m.jpg" width="175" align="left" border="0" />If there is an explanation for the obvious overkill in the murder of Albert Snyder, it must be that Ruth&rsquo;s previous attempts to snuff out the life of her husband (twice by asphyxiation and once by poison) had failed &ndash; and she wasn&rsquo;t about to give up. Ruth had persuaded her husband to take out a double indemnity policy, which would pay&nbsp;her in the event of his accidental death. It was the lure of the $97,000 worth of life insurance that compelled her to continue with her diabolical schemes until she succeeded. </p>
<p>Fueled by two bottles of whiskey and profound stupidity, the criminally-challenged duo staged the murder scene as a burglary gone horribly wrong. But their pathetic plan was doomed to failure. They threw an Italian language newspaper on the floor as a false clue to the identity of the killers. They emptied dresser drawers and overturned chairs. And in an act that would eventually help prosecutors to prove her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, Ruth hid her allegedly stolen jewelry under her mattress, about three feet away from Albert&rsquo;s battered body! </p>
<p>The trial of Ruth and Judd would be a media circus, and celebrities such as director D.W. Griffith, and evangelists Billy Sunday and Aimee Semple McPherson would attend. Ruth would be called &ldquo;ruthless Ruth&rdquo;, &ldquo;vampire&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;blonde fiend&rdquo; by the press. Evidently not all men found those appellations a turn-off, because Ruth received at least 160 marriage proposals during her incarceration. <img loading="lazy" title="DEAD" height="312" alt="DEAD" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2268/2118797280_b48c64d100_o.jpg" width="217" align="right" border="0" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately for Ruth, her plea for clemency would be denied by Governor Al Smith. Her execution would be famously recorded by newspaper man Tom Howard. The ingenious reporter had strapped a miniature <a title="ankle camera" href="http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object.cfm?key=35&#038;objkey=160" target="_blank">camera</a> to his ankle beneath his trousers. Just as the executioner threw the switch on the whimpering murderess, Tom raised the cuff of his pants and snapped the tabloid photo of a lifetime. </p>
<p>The murderers were unexceptional, but their crime inspired art. <a title="Machinal" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machinal" target="_blank">&ldquo;Machinal&rdquo;,</a> a play by Sophie Treadwell was deemed one of the best of 1928-29. <a title="James M Cain" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_M_Cain" target="_blank">James M. Cain&rsquo;s</a> brilliant novels &ldquo;Double Indemnity&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Postman Always Rings Twice&rdquo; are said to have been inspired by Albert Snyder&rsquo;s murder. And, of course, each of the novels translated into two of the finest examples of film noir ever produced. </p>

<p>Los Angeles<br />
August 28, 1927</p>
<p>Five days ago, twenty Mexican Ã¢â‚¬Å“rebelsÃ¢â‚¬Â descended on a train carrying among its passengers a group of American schoolteachers headed back to Los Angeles after a summer session at the University of Mexico. Eyewitnesses said about 40 shots were fired into the cars, one of which hit 27-year-old Florence M. Anderson of 3414 Third Avenue, Los Angeles, in the left hip. Anderson, a popular member of the travel party, was taken to a hospital in Maztalan. Doctors operated on the stricken high-school Spanish teacher, but peritonitis set in and she died later the same day, the only passenger injured in the melee. </p>
<p>Now comes word that Florence AndersonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father and a cousin, Mrs. Jean Garrison, are fighting over the disposition of her body, which arrived in Los Angeles early today. </p>
<p>Spokane newspaperman Charles H. Anderson, says that Florence sent him letters from Mexico in which she declared her affection for him. He says he is Ã¢â‚¬Å“puzzledÃ¢â‚¬Â by the relationship between Garrison and his daughter, and pointed to news reports which first described them as aunt and niece, then as cousins. At any rate, he intends to have Florence buried Ã¢â‚¬Å“with her ancestorsÃ¢â‚¬Â in CaliforniaÃ¢â‚¬â€and asked Southern Pacific to release his daughterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s body to him.</p>
<p>Jean Garrison, on the other hand, claims to have her cousinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s will, handwritten less than two months ago on the eve of her departure for Mexico. It states that Florence Anderson wished to be buried next to her mother in a Denver cemetery. </p>
<p>The tiebreaker was an affidavit filled out this morning by Francis Flynn, manager of the ill-fated tour group. Ã¢â‚¬Å“When Miss Anderson was shot and afraid she would die,Ã¢â‚¬Â Flynn told reporters, Ã¢â‚¬Å“she called me over and told me to send her things to Mrs. Garrison and to notify her about everything, but that her father was not to be communicated with.Ã¢â‚¬Â There were Ã¢â‚¬Å“strained relationsÃ¢â‚¬Â between them and Ã¢â‚¬Å“she had had only two communications from him in recent years.Ã¢â‚¬Â </p>
<p>The will and affidavit were good enough for Southern Pacific, which released Florence AndersonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s body to Mrs. Jean Garrison. Both are en route to Colorado. It is also being reported that Garrison has Ã¢â‚¬Å“demanded through the State Department $100,000 [approximately $1.2 million today] reparations of the Mexican government for her cousinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death.Ã¢â‚¬Â</p>
<p><i>Postscript</i>. Charles Anderson gave it one more shot. On September 1, 1927, the <i>Times</i> reported that he had retained counsel and asked for a photographic copy of his daughterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s will, which left the bulk of her $10,000 estate (about $118,000 in 2007) for the education of two young cousins, Claire and Arthur Strong (ages 13 and 11, respectively). Perhaps he thought better of it; the <i>Times</i> makes no further mention of this sordid mess.

<p>July 5, 1927<br />Venice&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was April 12, 1924, south of the border down Mehico way, when two brigands confronted Fedosis Alvarado on his ranch near Monte Escobeda, stole $2400 and shot him dead when he tried to defend his property. Arrested for the crime, Santiago Figueroa used the victim&#8217;s money to avoid prison time.</p>
<p>Fedosis&#8217; daughter, Maria Alvarado Gomez, was not satified with the verdict, and when she heard her father&#8217;s killer had moved to the beach at Los Angeles, she followed, taking a home at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=1508+Pennsylvania+Avenue,+Santa+Monica,+ca&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=63.215425,105.117188&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.032034,-118.469524&#038;spn=0.016467,0.025663&#038;z=15&#038;iwloc=cent&#038;om=1" target="_blank">1508 Pennsylvania Avenue, Santa Monica</a>. She haunted the public spaces along the shore, not in a spirit of seaside pleasure seeking, but in single-minded pursuit of the man whose face was burned into her brain.</p>
<p>Last night, as crowds packed the streets of Venice for Fourth of July revelry, she finally saw him and cried out to her friends, &quot;There he is, the murderer of my father, hold him, don&#8217;t let him get away!&quot;&nbsp; But in Spanish, because, you know, everyone involved spoke Spanish.</p>
<p>Traffic Officer Carter happened on the scene and took the players into custody, calling in auto camp manager Howard Wesson to translate. Once the story was explained, an envoy was dispatched to the Mexican Consulate, to determine if Figueroa was wanted in his homeland.</p>
<p>Obviously not, since there was no follow up story on the incident. Poor Maria. Should there be a next time, may we suggest she be prepared to exact her own swift justice on her prey, and not make the mistake of trusting law or nations to supply a daughter&#8217;s long overdue justice.</p>

Gordon Whitehead, a McGill University student.&nbsp; Bess Houdini would receive a settlement of $25,000 ($296,962 USD 2007).</div>
<div align="left">Of course, New York Life had good reason to be confused.&nbsp; Even today, Houdini&#8217;s death is surrounded by uncertainty.&nbsp; Some accounts say that Whitehead challenged Houdini to take the punch fair and square, while others claim that he and his buddies lambasted the illusionist while he reclined on a sofa.&nbsp; According to some, the blow to the abdomen could have ruptured Houdini&#8217;s appendix, while others today say that this would only have aggravated a pre-existing condition.&nbsp; Still others speculate that he was actually poisoned by the angry Spiritualists he&#8217;d discredited.&nbsp; As recently as March of this year, Harry&#8217;s descendents were seeking to have the body exhumed, while Bess&#8217;s sought to block it, claiming that the whole thing reeked of a book promotion stunt.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s a humble claims adjuster to do?</p></div>

<p>Governor Simpson declared today that the homes of thousands of French Acadiana and Spanish Creoles in St. Bernard and Plaquemines parishes were tomorrow going to be deep underwater.&nbsp; And not just because nature was being nature, but because Simpson was to dynamite the levees, sentencing a huge swath of hunters and trappers to homeless oblivion. </p>
<p>The folks of&nbsp; &ldquo;Evangeline,&rdquo; who knew exile only too well, trudged away in a debouch forty miles long while the muddy water of thirty-one states poured past.&nbsp;</p>
