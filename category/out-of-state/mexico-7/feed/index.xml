<p>Los Angeles<br />
August 28, 1927</p>
<p>Five days ago, twenty Mexican Ã¢â‚¬Å“rebelsÃ¢â‚¬Â descended on a train carrying among its passengers a group of American schoolteachers headed back to Los Angeles after a summer session at the University of Mexico. Eyewitnesses said about 40 shots were fired into the cars, one of which hit 27-year-old Florence M. Anderson of 3414 Third Avenue, Los Angeles, in the left hip. Anderson, a popular member of the travel party, was taken to a hospital in Maztalan. Doctors operated on the stricken high-school Spanish teacher, but peritonitis set in and she died later the same day, the only passenger injured in the melee. </p>
<p>Now comes word that Florence AndersonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father and a cousin, Mrs. Jean Garrison, are fighting over the disposition of her body, which arrived in Los Angeles early today. </p>
<p>Spokane newspaperman Charles H. Anderson, says that Florence sent him letters from Mexico in which she declared her affection for him. He says he is Ã¢â‚¬Å“puzzledÃ¢â‚¬Â by the relationship between Garrison and his daughter, and pointed to news reports which first described them as aunt and niece, then as cousins. At any rate, he intends to have Florence buried Ã¢â‚¬Å“with her ancestorsÃ¢â‚¬Â in CaliforniaÃ¢â‚¬”and asked Southern Pacific to release his daughterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s body to him.</p>
<p>Jean Garrison, on the other hand, claims to have her cousinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s will, handwritten less than two months ago on the eve of her departure for Mexico. It states that Florence Anderson wished to be buried next to her mother in a Denver cemetery. </p>
<p>The tiebreaker was an affidavit filled out this morning by Francis Flynn, manager of the ill-fated tour group. Ã¢â‚¬Å“When Miss Anderson was shot and afraid she would die,Ã¢â‚¬Â Flynn told reporters, Ã¢â‚¬Å“she called me over and told me to send her things to Mrs. Garrison and to notify her about everything, but that her father was not to be communicated with.Ã¢â‚¬Â There were Ã¢â‚¬Å“strained relationsÃ¢â‚¬Â between them and Ã¢â‚¬Å“she had had only two communications from him in recent years.Ã¢â‚¬Â </p>
<p>The will and affidavit were good enough for Southern Pacific, which released Florence AndersonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s body to Mrs. Jean Garrison. Both are en route to Colorado. It is also being reported that Garrison has Ã¢â‚¬Å“demanded through the State Department $100,000 [approximately $1.2 million today] reparations of the Mexican government for her cousinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death.Ã¢â‚¬Â</p>
<p><i>Postscript</i>. Charles Anderson gave it one more shot. On September 1, 1927, the <i>Times</i> reported that he had retained counsel and asked for a photographic copy of his daughterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s will, which left the bulk of her $10,000 estate (about $118,000 in 2007) for the education of two young cousins, Claire and Arthur Strong (ages 13 and 11, respectively). Perhaps he thought better of it; the <i>Times</i> makes no further mention of this sordid mess.

<p>July 5, 1927<br />Venice&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was April 12, 1924, south of the border down Mehico way, when two brigands confronted Fedosis Alvarado on his ranch near Monte Escobeda, stole $2400 and shot him dead when he tried to defend his property. Arrested for the crime, Santiago Figueroa used the victim&#8217;s money to avoid prison time.</p>
<p>Fedosis&#8217; daughter, Maria Alvarado Gomez, was not satified with the verdict, and when she heard her father&#8217;s killer had moved to the beach at Los Angeles, she followed, taking a home at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=1508+Pennsylvania+Avenue,+Santa+Monica,+ca&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=63.215425,105.117188&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.032034,-118.469524&#038;spn=0.016467,0.025663&#038;z=15&#038;iwloc=cent&#038;om=1" target="_blank">1508 Pennsylvania Avenue, Santa Monica</a>. She haunted the public spaces along the shore, not in a spirit of seaside pleasure seeking, but in single-minded pursuit of the man whose face was burned into her brain.</p>
<p>Last night, as crowds packed the streets of Venice for Fourth of July revelry, she finally saw him and cried out to her friends, &quot;There he is, the murderer of my father, hold him, don&#8217;t let him get away!&quot;&nbsp; But in Spanish, because, you know, everyone involved spoke Spanish.</p>
<p>Traffic Officer Carter happened on the scene and took the players into custody, calling in auto camp manager Howard Wesson to translate. Once the story was explained, an envoy was dispatched to the Mexican Consulate, to determine if Figueroa was wanted in his homeland.</p>
<p>Obviously not, since there was no follow up story on the incident. Poor Maria. Should there be a next time, may we suggest she be prepared to exact her own swift justice on her prey, and not make the mistake of trusting law or nations to supply a daughter&#8217;s long overdue justice.</p>
