<p>Was Los Angeles nearly ground zero for a Cretaceous-tertiary extinction event-styled piece of catastrophism?&nbsp; Sort of.&nbsp; Not really.</p>
<p>An asteroid nearly reached the open field near the home of Joseph Phillis, at the corner of <a href="https://maps.yahoo.com/;_ylc=X3oDMTExNmIycG51BF9TAzI3MTYxNDkEc2VjA2ZwLWJ1dHRvbgRzbGsDbGluaw--#mvt=m&#038;q1=MCCOLLUM+PL+AT+BERKELEY+AVE%2C+Los+Angeles%2C+CA%2C+90026&#038;trf=0&#038;lon=-118.266084&#038;lat=34.0862&#038;mag=3" target="_blank" title="mccullom">McCullom and Berkeley</a> early this morning.&nbsp; It exploded just before impact, leaving a burned patch twelve feet in diameter.&nbsp; The neighborhood was filled with heavy sulphurous smoke, in the center of which burned a dim blue flame.</p>
<p>Surrounding homes were rocked by the loud explosion and lit up by a Fourth of July spectacular, but the only extant remains of our spacejectile the shaken denizens could find were chunks of meteorite that resembled volcanic rock.</p>
<p>Otherwise neighbors, and dinosaurs, were not affected.</p>

<p>October 3, 1907<br />Edendale<img loading="lazy" width="444" height="127" border="0" align="right" src="//static.flickr.com/90/259983728_7d7706d0e9_o.gif" alt="edendale1" title="edendale1" /></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 2006, and Edendale is the <em>quaintest</em> durn area of Silver Lake, where you may dine at the Edendale Grill and think back on when Edendale was full of Keystone Kops and horses from Tom Mix&rsquo;s Mixville Studios.&nbsp; You can mull over Edendale&rsquo;s history as the birthing-place of identity politics, where gay rights began and Communists cruised the hills and bohemianism was actually daring.&nbsp; And now, next time you&rsquo;re in Edendale, I hope you think of Mr. A. B. Wright.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jennie Gamble bought a lot in Edendale when it was laid out in 1903, and built a nice little four-room cottage.&nbsp; She decided to sell in 1907, and did so, to the aforementioned Mr. Wright, the $1200 deal was closed, and Mrs. Gamble deposited her deed with a trust company.&nbsp; All fine and good, except for one thing:&nbsp; A. B. Wright is black.</p>
<p>The neighborhood went nuts, threatening &ldquo;dire things&rdquo; and making uncomplimentary remarks to Mrs. Gamble.&nbsp; A great banner was raised, announcing a mass meeting set for tonight to protest against the incursion. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But the protest was averted, as R. R. Carew, original promoter of Edendale and a resident therein, &ldquo;proved to be the Moses in the present difficulty, and led his people out of trouble.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he would have been in trouble indeed, in that he had personally assured prospective homemakers that no black family would be allowed to settle in the community.&nbsp; What Carew said to Wright is unknown, but Wright did ultimately decide <em>not</em> to move his family into Edendale.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="174" border="0" align="absbottom" src="//static.flickr.com/97/259983397_9fa9542d72_o.gif" alt="edendale2" title="edendale2" /></p>
<p>There still aren&#8217;t a lot of black people in Edendale.&nbsp;</p>
