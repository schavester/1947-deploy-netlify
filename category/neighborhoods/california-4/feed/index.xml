<p>September 22, 1907<br />Venice&nbsp;</p>
<p>Someone&#8211;perhaps a drunken and disgruntled cook who was fired last night&#8211;snuck into the larder of the Ship Hotel around midnight and brought forth a great quantity of luxury foodstuffs, which were cast into the surf. It was no easy job. Three whole loins of beef, 200 pounds in weight, 250 pounds of clams and a number of oysters from eastern climes were among the waste found on the sand with dawn&#8217;s light. </p>

<p>July 30, 1907<br /> Avalon, Catalina Island&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who owns the sea, the islands and their calm coves? Is it god, or man who lays claim upon places of value in the world?</p>
<p>On Santa Catalina Island, a consortium run by the Banning family has seized control of most of the landable sections of the Avalon cove, and demands a 12 1/2% cut of all ship&#8217;s profits for the privilege of using the wharves. Most of the island&#8217;s boatmen agreed to pony up for the Santa Catalina Island Company surcharge, but a few rebelious sorts sniffed they&#8217;d find their own landings, thankyouverymuch.</p>
<p>Pity the unfortunate passengers who go out fishing with these rebels, quite unaware that permission to land on dry wood does not come with the price of passage! At Avalon today, an independent boatman named &quot;Chappie&quot; returned with a party of four and sought to land at the wharf, as a lady was aboard. He got into a physical altercation with an officer of the SCIC, and clouted the man with his gaff hook, then was swatted with a billyclub and knocked unconscious for ten minutes. </p>
<p>The lady was allowed to disembark onto the wharf, where is was discovered she had suffered a nasty wound straight through the web of her hand, from someone&#8217;s swinging blade unseen. The punchy &quot;Chappie&quot; meanwhile put his male passengers ashore along the beach, a most ignoble end to a day&#8217;s sport fishing. </p>

<p>April 15, 1907<br />
Pasadena</p>
<p>As criminality reaches epidemic proportions in sleepy Pasadena, the citizenry grumbles about Chief Pinkham&#8217;s skills as police head, and makes noises about replacing him.</p>
<p>The latest outrage was visited upon George Syer, a public carriage driver who was called out to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=876+lincoln+ave.,+pasadena,+CA&amp;ll=34.152727,-118.157487&amp;spn=0.014987,0.040383" target="_blank">876 Lincoln Avenue</a> this evening, ostensibly to take some women to a train. The address should have been found north of Mountain, in an unlit area. He did not find the house, but while looking was acosted by a man with a thick Irish brogue who demanded his money. Syer parted with a dollar in change, but kept the contents of his other pocket. No mention was made of a weapon being brandished, but it is well known that one can&#8217;t be too careful with Irishmen!</p>

<p>A special correspondent follows up on the distressing report of a cow gravely injured when struck by an electric car near <a href="http://www.wemweb.com/railroad-stations/ref30.html" target="_blank">Lamanda Park</a>. Bossy was found happily chewing her cud with no sign of injury. As near as can be figured, the trolley ran over the cow&#8217;s tether, pulling it taut and forcing the reluctant acrobat to turn a dramatic aerial flip. She seems to have landed safely and forgotten all about her wild adventure, until the cries of do-gooders to the Humane Society roused an interest in her case. </p>
