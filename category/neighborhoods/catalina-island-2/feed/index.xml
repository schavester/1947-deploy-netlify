<div>
<div align="left">January 16, 1927</div>
<div align="left">Palos Verdes Peninsula, CA</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left"><img loading="lazy" width="268" height="398" border="0" align="left" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2127/2197430661_8d68b0bc23_o.jpg" alt="georgeyoung" title="georgeyoung" /> </div>
<div align="left">In 1919, the <a href="https://1947project.com/?p=2222" target="_blank" title="williamwrigley">heavily insured</a> William Wrigley Jr. bought a controlling interest in the Santa Catalina Island Co., and sought to promote his lovely little island getaway.&nbsp; And what better publicity stunt for the Roaring 20s than a contest of endurance?&nbsp; Yes, a winter swim from Catalina to Point Vicente would be just the thing for those flagpole-sitting, dance marathoning types.</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">Wrigley offered a prize of $25,000 to the first man to finish the January 15 channel swim, and $15,000 to the first woman.&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">The Wrigley Ocean Marathon attracted over 100 competitors, including a 17-year-old Canadian boy named George Young.&nbsp; Young held several Canadian swimming records, but was too poor to afford a ticket to Los Angeles.&nbsp; He did, however, have a friend with a motorcycle, and together they made the long haul from Toronto.&nbsp; The bike broke down in Arizona, where Young was picked up by a honeymooning couple, who drove him the rest of the way.</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">His perserverance paid off.&nbsp; Around 3am on January 16, after swimming for nearly 16 hours, Young was declared the winner of Wrigley&#8217;s challenge.&nbsp; In fact, he was the <em>only</em> competitor to finish the race.&nbsp; With water temperatures hovering in the 50s, over 2/3 of the contestants dropped out after just a few hours.</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">Young caused a stir when he emerged from the surf in the nude.&nbsp; The modest Young said, &quot;We put a covering of graphite over the grease before I put on my bathing suit to help keep out the cold&#8230; I had taken off my bathing suit when I was two and one half miles from Catalina, and I forgot that grease and graphite were my only covering as I rose out of the water.&quot;</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">Two women, Margaret Hauser of Long Beach and Martha Stager of Portland, OR, were awarded prize money, despite not completing the race.&nbsp; Only a mile from the finish line, Hauser was pulled from the water by her husband/trainer after 19 hours and 26 minutes, making her the contestant who lasted the longest.&nbsp; When Wrigley heard the news, he said, &quot;Shucks!&nbsp; That&#8217;s too bad.&nbsp; Give them each $2500 for their remarkable attempts.&quot;</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">Sadly, Young&#8217;s career fell apart soon after the race.&nbsp; His manager turned down a $250,000 movie offer, believing he could get more money.&nbsp; But there weren&#8217;t any other offers, and Young never again recaptured his glory he enjoyed as &quot;The Catalina Kid.&quot;</div>

<div>September 26, 1907<img loading="lazy" width="444" height="129" border="0" align="right" src="//static.flickr.com/93/253514290_c661c01555_o.gif" alt="deathinsea" title="deathinsea" /><br />Avalon</p>
<p>Dan Bulkeley was a Pasadena man, well educated and of financial means, living with his cousins Lucy and Jennie Bulkeley at 58 North Pasadena Avenue.&nbsp; Every summer since &rsquo;95 they&rsquo;ve passed the season in a tent house on Sumner Avenue in the city of Avalon, on the Banning Brother&rsquo;s Isle of Santa Catalina, off the Los Angeles coast.</p>
<p>Lucy and Jennie departed for Pasadena today and Dan, despondent at being left alone, engaged the launch Adelade to take him on a fishing trip.&nbsp; Near the Seal Rocks, Dan stood up and told the boatman that there were letters to be found under the seat, and that his pockets were filled with rocks.&nbsp; With that, Dan Bulkeley stepped from the boat and into the Pacific, his final home.</p>
<p>There was one letter to Lucy, one to the boatman containing five dollars, and another to a J. L. Wegman containing fifteen dollars, and instructions regarding taking down his tent.</p>
<p>Speaking of the briny deep, what was the biggest story of September, 1907?&nbsp; Why, that honor would go to the maiden voyage of the mighty <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Lusitania" target="_blank" title="lusitania">Lusitania</a>, wherein supremacy over the sea was regained by Cunard over the Hamburg-American line.</p>
