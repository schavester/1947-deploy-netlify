<p>July 6, 1907<br /> Los Angeles&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hot! damn but it&#8217;s been hot and humid, too, the steamiest early July since records have been kept. Sure there were hotter single days&#8211;like July 25, 1891 when the mercury topped 109&#8211;but no one can recall a week when the very dawn temperature broke 80 degrees, with no relief offered by the night.</p>
<p>Mrs. Carrie Gilbert&#8217;s solution to the grisly weather was to get drunk and sleep out-of-doors, not in a cosy sleepying porch at home at 617 1/2 East Sixth Street, but alongside the railway behind the commission house at First and Central Streets. Deep in the darkness her horrible screams were heard; a passing train had severed her left foot. Taken to Receiving Hospital, the lady slipped into a merciful stupor. Clever, clever dipsomaniac. Shock, they say, leaves one feeling <em>icy cold</em>&#8230; </p>

<p>March 20, 1907<br /> Los Angeles&nbsp;</p>
<p>Revealed today, with the arrest of M.M. Martinez, proprietor of the Esmeralda Club at Amelia and Ducommon Streets, is a terrible tale of innocence stolen. Several young girls are willing to testify that their virtue was taken from them by Martinez and club regulars following the introduction of drugged champagne into their tender mouths.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="443" height="373" border="0" src="//static.flickr.com/45/116181282_6916ed8378_o.jpg" /> </p>
<p>Inside the walls of this vile palace of sin unfolded the debauchery of Miss Nellie McCarthy, 668 Date Street, and Miss Julia Wood, 812 South Wall Street. Both girls are just 17 years old, and are telling their stories to Proscecuting Attorney Adcock, and are willing to repeat these horrors for a jury. The girls are being &quot;sent to Whittier&quot; because their parents do not know what to do with them.</p>
<p>Martinez&#8217; arrest came about at the insistence of the mothers of the broken blossoms, who declared their children were pure and lovely in character before they began attending social events at the noisome venue. &nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="//static.flickr.com/54/116202461_29ab0a9ee9_o.jpg" />&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Editrix&#8217; note: &quot;sent to Whittier&quot; is a euphemism that was apparently familiar enough to the readers of the 1907 newspapers to require no further elaboration. By reading numerous c. 1900 stories that included the phrase, most dealing with delinquent and sexually promiscuous youths, I discovered that Whittier was the location of the State Reformatory (above), opened in 1891; it operated as the Fred C. Nelles School through 2004, and is currently being <a href="https://www.whittiergreenleaf.com/" target="_blank">redeveloped</a> as a residential/commercial project. Henceforth I will threaten Nathan that he will be &quot;sent to Whittier&quot; should he misbehave.</em> </p>
