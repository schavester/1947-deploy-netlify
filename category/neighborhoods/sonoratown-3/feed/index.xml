<p>August 3, 1907<br />Sonoratown</p>
<p><em>Beware the Plaza</em>.&nbsp; Patrolmen do their best to beat down and drag away human fiends, filled as they are with a new drug menace and the awful blood-lust it produces.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In the labyrinths and dens of Sonoratown, violent outbreaks have become commonplace, as Mexicans of the lower caste have been frequenting drug stores to purchase a substance said to be more harmful in its effects than cocaine, morphine, or even opium.&nbsp; Victims of the powerful narcotic&mdash;its scientific name, Cannabis Indica&mdash;are helpless to control their need for it, or the frenzy it produces.&nbsp; An effort will now be made to regulate the sale of this poison.</p>
<p>The initial effects of Cannabis pellets, called &ldquo;Hashish,&rdquo; consist of mad exhilaration (especially, it is noted, involving one&rsquo;s mistaken ability to lift heavy objects) and a distortion of the optic nerve, wherein men of ordinary size appear to be giants.</p>
<p>After its use for any length of time, a homicidal mania manifests itself, as under its influence, the desire to shed blood is uppermost in the mind.&nbsp; According to Police Surgeon J. Sumner Quint, much of the crime in the Mexican community is due to its use.</p>
<p>This writer urges all readers to steer clear from this terrible peril and its attendant misery!</p>

<p>June 14, 1907<br /> Sonoratown</p>
<p>Mrs. Santos Rodriguez (nee Galvies) has a lover, Virde Parra. She also has a little 3-year-old daughter, and watching the babe was putting a crimp in her romantic life. A quick trip down to the druggist provided mama with what was almost certainly a bottle of lauadanum, that effective blend of opium and alcohol so beloved by Coleridge and de Quincey. As the child slipped into a powerful sleep illuminated with extraordinary visions, Santos slipped out of her little house at 643 Buena Vista Street and met Virde for a quickie at the La Guerra Hotel on North Main Street near Market.</p>
<p>But the lovers&#8217; plans were thwarted when the lady&#8217;s husband, having heard rumors of her evening wanders and Parra&#8217;s visits, came home for an early dinner and discovered his child insensible. Patrolmen Leon and Murphy were called, and the child-doper and her honey were quickly found and placed in police custody, where the lady gave her maiden name and refused to talk about the case.</p>

<p>On Sunday, April 16, a merry busload of crime geeks boarded our stretch hearse (actually a plush touring coach, courtesy of our pal <a href="http://www.laweekly.com/la-people-2006/sitting-bull/13232/" target="_blank">Dennis</a> at American Transporation Systems) for a five-hour tour into the weird crannies and freaky nooks of downtown Los Angeles and Chinatown. From the <a href="http://www.47upgradepath7.richardschave.com//tags/oconnor-electro-plating-company" target="_blank">O&#8217;Connor Electroplating Disaster</a> to the hairy ghoul gal of Old Sonoratown, severed hands to rotting panhandlers, deadly Xmas gifts to fake mediums, it was a delightful dip into the weird old L.A. that&#8217;s not there anymore.</p>
<p>Here are a few photographic impressions to mark the day. And if you&#8217;d like a spin on the Crime Bus, please note: Nightmares of Bunker Hill <a href="http://www.dumplinglab.com/crimebus/?q=bunkerhilljune" target="_blank">rolls again</a> on June 10.</p>
