<p>At the turn of the century. Eltinge became well known for his parodies of iconic female figures like the Gibson Girl (his was the &quot;Simpson Girl&quot;), and was lauded as &quot;the most fascinating woman on the American stage.&quot;&nbsp; In 1910, he opened <em><img loading="lazy" width="222" height="300" border="0" align="right" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1239/1442772795_f20585441f_o.jpg" alt="eltinge2" title="eltinge2" />The Fascinating Widow</em>, a musical comedy where he played both male and female roles, the latter of which would become his signature role.&nbsp; Eltinge was a hit, marketing his own line of magazines featuring beauty tips, as well as a line of cosmetics.&nbsp; Ads for his cold cream read, &quot;See what the Julian Eltinge cold cream does for a man.&nbsp; Imagine what it will do for a woman.&quot;</p>
<p>Eltinge enjoyed a fairly successful career in silent film, though his weight, age, and reported alcohol abuse made it difficult for him to continue to play an ingenue.&nbsp; Additionally, Hollywood laws that made it illegal for a man to perform in women&#8217;s clothing reduced his act to singing in a tuxedo while pointing at a rack of dresses.</p>
<p>Throughout his life, he vehemently denied rumors that he was a homosexual, saying, &quot;I am not gay.&nbsp; I just like pearls.&quot;</p>
