<p>October 23, 1927<br />Los Angeles  </p>
<p>John A. Horn was born to be a poet but Fate (O! cruel mistress she!) decreed he make his living as a lingerie salesman. Worse, he was married to a woman who did not understand the lyricism of his delicate artist&#8217;s soul. So he left his wife&mdash;but not before explaining himself in verse.   </p>
<p>Martha Horn, seeking a divorce upon the grounds of desertion, recently handed her errant husband&#8217;s scribbled magnum opus to Judge Gates:    </p>
<p><em>&quot;I&#8217;ll wait here &#8217;till the sun sets,&quot; I told her<br />&quot;If you are hungry, there&#8217;s a stand upon the pier.&quot;<br />She nodded. &quot;You can wait. I won&#8217;t be long.&quot;<br />And saying this, she left me with the sun.<br />I sat upon the sand and watched the gulls<br />Skimming the restless water striped with gold.<br />The rolling waves tossed foam upon the beach;<br />&quot;The lacy underthings the Old World wears,&quot;<br />I told myself, then smiled quite satisfied:<br />Not many a clerk in a department store<br />From seven to six could say such clever things.<br />. . . . the sun<br />Was almost gone, the rounded golden edge<br />Was sinking out of sight when my wife called<br />&quot;John.&quot; I saw her coming down the beach<br />Munching a bun. &quot;I&#8217;ve one for you,&quot; she said.<br />I turned. The sun had sunk into the sea.</em>  </p>
<p>&quot;And when I gave him the hot dog, he got sore,&quot; Mrs. Horn clarified for the court.   </p>
<p>&quot;This is just another example of the ancient controversy between rhyme and reason,&quot; chortled Judge Gates before granting a divorce to the long-suffering Mrs. Horn.   </p>

<p>During tonight&rsquo;s dinnertime&mdash;the fashionable hour for society at the Hotel Van Nuys at Fourth and Main (Morgan &amp; Walls, 1896) a furry friend decided to hobnob with the upper crust.&nbsp; Strolling in through the Fourth Street entrance like the most gracious of chaps, of which there were many in the lobby, came a great husky sewer rat. &nbsp;<img loading="lazy" width="415" height="279" border="0" align="right" title="vannuys" alt="vannuys" src="//static.flickr.com/98/259928223_ad0f6b3a33_o.jpg" /></p>
<p>Pandemonium ensued:&nbsp; &ldquo;Dainty Parisian lingerie and open-work stockings appeared on view.&nbsp; Gallant gentlemen dropped their cigars and ladies jumped on chairs, but still the rat stood his ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Porters and elevator boys descended, and Mr. Rattus fled the scene through a hole in some missing wainscoting (the Van Nuys undergoing some changes to the lobby).&nbsp; Immediately the house ferret, kept in the engine room for just this sort of affair, was thrust into the opening. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A loud, chilling three-round bout ensued inside the wall, and the ferret emerged bloody and beaten.&nbsp; The rat stuck his nose out his hiding place as if to challenge all comers, and another ferret, this one less soft and over-weight, was sent in to dispatch the venturesome intruder.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The story headline says the rat was killed, but the actual tale makes no such mention.&nbsp; Without a body, I&rsquo;d say Mr. Ferret merely bragged about besting his opponent, and Mr. Rat went off to the Rosslyn, or perhaps the King Edward.</p>
<p>(The Van Nuys became the Hotel Barclay in the 1930s [adding a magnificent art deco neon blade sign]. The Barclay is now one of the many &ldquo;28-day-shuffle&rdquo; transient hotels in the area, where monthly rent is $360.)</p>
