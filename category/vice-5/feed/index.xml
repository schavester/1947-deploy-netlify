<p><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="108" border="0" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2363/1780348717_d7617f4d16_o.jpg" alt="dreamland" title="dreamland" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="235" height="143" border="0" align="left" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2349/1780348729_f74905b10f_o.jpg" alt="fightinpriests" title="fightinpriests" />What gives?&nbsp; Well, it&rsquo;s 1927, and saucy soubrettes kicking up their heels (oh you kid!) in the undesirable theaters of Street Main was too much for the dogooding Men of the Cloth, who remembered a time when there was no such flapping, before ladies in their runabouts had bathtub gin on the breath of a mouth slathered in kiss-proof lipstick and the men who love them, and so forth, and it was time to put a stop to it.&nbsp; On October 27, pioneering radio evangelists Dr. Gustav Briegleb and the Rev. Robert P. &ldquo;<a title="fightinbob" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_P._Shuler">Fighting Bob</a>&rdquo; Shuler took in the show at the Follies, and called in the coppers to shut it down tonight.&nbsp; On November 29, Shuler and Briegleb were called to the stand to testify as to the show&rsquo;s indecency.&nbsp; Follies showgirls put on a good show at the Hall of Justice, too, as they loudly hissed the ministers.&nbsp; (Of course they hissed!&nbsp; Are they not <a title="serpents!" target="_blank" href="http://witcombe.sbc.edu/eve-women/5eveserpent.html">serpents</a> leading men astray as She did at the Fall of Man?!)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="238" height="211" border="0" align="right" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2152/1780348699_5f5c3edf7a_o.jpg" alt="blushing" title="blushing" />It&rsquo;s a good thing counsel made a point of selecting an all-male jury, as the vivid descriptions of indecent dances, songs, jokes and costumes brought blushes to the faces of jurors, court spectators and court attaches during the trial.&nbsp; The highlight of the trial was Rev. Shuler himself, who read from his copious, filthy notes, which recounted a lewd performance between two girls playing the parts of deserted wives looking for their husbands in the barroom of a ship.&nbsp; And Shuler&rsquo;s dead-on imitation of a &ldquo;licentious smile&rdquo; which he asserted to be part of the dancers&rsquo; repertoire brought such an outburst from the crowd of spectators (and the Hot Mamma girls) that the bailiff threatened to clear the courtroom.</p>
<p>Preacher Briegleb minced no words:&nbsp; &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t have enough clothes on to flag a handcar,&rdquo; said he, and described the activities of the chorus as &ldquo;a moving sea of contortions of all that was low and vile.&rdquo;&nbsp; Defense counsel asked that the good minister confine himself to the facts, but what fun is that?&nbsp; In the dancers&rsquo; defense, Dorothy Walton, the blonde &ldquo;Cleopatra&rdquo; of the play, described her dancing as being &ldquo;combinations of modern and classical steps&rdquo; in which, she admitted, did in fact move every part of her body. &nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="485" height="67" border="0" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2063/1780348767_862783ffed_o.jpg" alt="follies27ad" title="follies27ad" /></p>
<p>Which seemed hunky-dory with the aforementioned all-male jury, who set the lot free, save for four defendants&mdash;Tom B. Dalton, Robert Whalen, Harry Graves and Charles B. Dameron&mdash;found guilty based on their admitted connection with the management of the show and their writing of the dialogue.&nbsp; These Hot Papas were sentenced by Municipal Judge Frederickson to serve 150 days in the City Jail in addition to $500 ($5,515 USD2006) fines each:&nbsp; &ldquo;It is my clearly defined duty to impose the severest sentence possible upon these defendants in order that such performances will not continue in this city&hellip;certainly the dances staged with their help were not artistic as claimed by them.&nbsp; The defendants have had a fair and unbiased trial and convicted of a most serious offense to society.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="235" height="239" border="0" align="left" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2340/1780348777_e56dfc31f2_o.jpg" alt="folliesad1939" title="folliesad1939" />Needless to say, the Follies soldiered on.&nbsp; It was remodeled by <a title="scharleslee" target="_blank" href="http://digital.library.ucla.edu/sclee/">S. Charles Lee</a> in the 1930s, and thereafter saw many decades of shimmy-shammyin&rsquo; by <a title="lili" target="_blank" href="http://www.vivavavoom.com/girls/lili/photo.html">Lili St. Cyr</a>, <a title="anncorio" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Corio">Ann Corio</a> and <a title="bettyrowland" target="_blank" href="http://www.archive.org/details/stripper_betty_rowland">Betty &ldquo;Ball of Fire&rdquo; Rowland</a>.&nbsp; Eventually girlesque went the way of vaudeville, and the Follies became a skin-flick house.&nbsp; In 1968 <a title="eleanorgeeIthinkyou'reswell" target="_blank" href="http://www.publicartinla.com/CivicCenter/chambers1.html">Eleanor Chambers</a>, executive assistant to Mayor Yorty, led the fight to have the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Board add the Follies to its list of culturally significant buildings (who had just added a <a title="graumanshcm" target="_blank" href="http://bigorangelandmarks.blogspot.com/2007/08/no-55-graumans-chinese-theatre.html">theater</a> <em>and</em> something <a title="bullockshcm" target="_blank" href="http://bigorangelandmarks.blogspot.com/2007/08/no-56-bullocks-wilshire-building.html">art deco</a>).&nbsp; The board nixed that idea as beneath them (rejecting the <a title="burbanktheatre" target="_blank" href="http://cinematreasures.org/theater/1988/">Burbank</a>/<a title="burlesk" target="_blank" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_muE6ZaFcw_M/RjdmFhymdCI/AAAAAAAAABs/08kyz_MCvy4/s1600-h/burbank.jpg">Burlesk</a> at <a title="548southmain" target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=548+S+Main+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90013&#038;sll=34.046632,-118.249197&#038;sspn=0.008232,0.01354&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.04577,-118.24931&#038;spn=0.001029,0.001692&#038;t=k&#038;z=19&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1">548 South Main</a> as well).&nbsp;</p>

<p>And then, in May of 1974&mdash;the month that the House of Representatives opened its impeachment hearings against President Nixon, the Follies was razed, and now, in its place, stands the Ronald Reagan building:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="244" border="0" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2404/1783332063_d11efecfec_o.jpg" alt="barc-follies1" title="barc-follies1" /><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="243" border="0" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2331/1783332089_3e3c3260fd_o.jpg" alt="barc-follies2" title="barc-follies2" /></p>

<p>August 6, 1927<br />Los Angeles</p>
<p>Councilman Carl I. Jacobson was arrested in a morals raid at <a title="4732 Beagle Street" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=4732+Beagle+Street,+Los+Angeles,+CA&#038;sll=34.086893,-118.174889&#038;sspn=0.010876,0.018239&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.084512,-118.184609&#038;spn=0.010876,0.018239&#038;t=h&#038;z=16&#038;om=1" target="_blank">4372 Beagle Street</a> in the company of a woman who said her name was Mrs. <img loading="lazy" title="Councilman Jacobson" height="258" alt="Councilman Jacobson" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1291/1022195803_f2fff49cb4_o.jpg" width="141" align="right" border="0" />Hazel Ferguson, but who later admitted her real name was Mrs. Callie Grimes. </p>
<p>The married councilman insisted that he was framed and that the raid was the underworld&rsquo;s retaliation for his much publicized crusade against vice in the city. </p>
<p>Jacobson, who lives in a small bungalow at <a title="3014 Terry Place" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=3014+Terry+Place,+Los+Angeles,+CA&#038;sll=34.084512,-118.184609&#038;sspn=0.010876,0.018239&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;t=h&#038;z=16&#038;om=1" target="_blank">3014 Terry Place</a> with his wife of thirty years, told cops that he had called upon Mrs. Ferguson to discuss a matter of street assessments with her. He said Mrs. Ferguson had telephoned him at his home and asked him to look over her property to see if it was worth paying the assessments. </p>
<p>When he arrived for their meeting Mrs. Ferguson poured two cocktails, and then moments later all of the lights in the house went out. It was then that police announced themselves and placed Councilman Jacobson and Mrs. Ferguson/Grimes under arrest. </p>
<p>The four arresting officers, Captains of Detectives Wallis and Williams, and Detectives Lucas and Raymond related a version of events substantively different from Jacobson&rsquo;s account. They stated that they went to the Beagle street house, watched through a window and then observing what they felt constituted criminal behavior, crashed down a door to arrest the couple on morals violations. The arrest of Jacobson and Grimes begs the question: why were four high-ranking LAPD officers creeping around in the shrubbery with their noses pressed to a window like four Peeping Toms? </p>
<p>The case against Jacobsen would drag on. Jacobson would be tried twice on morals charges. In the first trial the jury would vote 9 to 3 for acquittal; in the second trial the jury would be evenly divided and the DA would decide against trying him for a third time. Mrs. Callie Grimes would confess to her part in the frame-up, and then recant. Grimes along with the four officers who conducted the raid would be tried for conspiracy, and the charges against them would be dismissed in 1929. </p>
<p>One of the detectives, Harry Raymond, would leave the LAPD and become a private investigator. He&rsquo;d turn up again in the news as the victim of an attempted assassination by car bomb, in a 1938 corruption scandal involving Los Angeles <a title="Frank Shaw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_L._Shaw" target="_blank">Mayor Frank Shaw</a>, members of his administration, and the LAPD. </p>

<p>March 20, 1907<br /> Los Angeles&nbsp;</p>
<p>Revealed today, with the arrest of M.M. Martinez, proprietor of the Esmeralda Club at Amelia and Ducommon Streets, is a terrible tale of innocence stolen. Several young girls are willing to testify that their virtue was taken from them by Martinez and club regulars following the introduction of drugged champagne into their tender mouths.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="443" height="373" border="0" src="//static.flickr.com/45/116181282_6916ed8378_o.jpg" /> </p>
<p>Inside the walls of this vile palace of sin unfolded the debauchery of Miss Nellie McCarthy, 668 Date Street, and Miss Julia Wood, 812 South Wall Street. Both girls are just 17 years old, and are telling their stories to Proscecuting Attorney Adcock, and are willing to repeat these horrors for a jury. The girls are being &quot;sent to Whittier&quot; because their parents do not know what to do with them.</p>
<p>Martinez&#8217; arrest came about at the insistence of the mothers of the broken blossoms, who declared their children were pure and lovely in character before they began attending social events at the noisome venue. &nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Editrix&#8217; note: &quot;sent to Whittier&quot; is a euphemism that was apparently familiar enough to the readers of the 1907 newspapers to require no further elaboration. By reading numerous c. 1900 stories that included the phrase, most dealing with delinquent and sexually promiscuous youths, I discovered that Whittier was the location of the State Reformatory (above), opened in 1891; it operated as the Fred C. Nelles School through 2004, and is currently being <a href="http://www.whittiergreenleaf.com/" target="_blank">redeveloped</a> as a residential/commercial project. Henceforth I will threaten Nathan that he will be &quot;sent to Whittier&quot; should he misbehave.</em> </p>
