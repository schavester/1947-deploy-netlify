<div>On routing duty in advance of the June 16 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.esotouric.com/fante">John Fante tour</a>, Richard and I zipped down to 826 Berendo, where the master penned his great <em>Ask the Dust,</em> only to discover it the most heartbreaking sort of eyesore, boarded up yet all too easy to access, home now to the sorts of miserable edge-dwelling citizens who were, after all, his particular interest. One of them has a talent for charcoal portraiture.<br /><a title="Photo Sharing" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/527988503/"><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="500" border="0" alt="wall art and window in Fante's house" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1185/527988503_972ae4559c.jpg" /></a><br />Richard returned with photog Meeno Peluce and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.2or3things.org/826berendo">documented</a> the miasma, then began calling city agencies in hopes, not of delaying the inevitable demolition, but of at least getting a plaque or street sign to honor the author and the work. Sadly, it seems the city only provides plaques for buildings that have been designated historic, and the only designation this poor, abandoned place is likely to get now is &quot;Pee-YOU!&quot; But we&#8217;ll keep trying; Fante deserves as much.</p>
<p>Stephen Cooper, author of <em>Full of Life: A Biography of John Fante</em> says, &quot;When <em>Ask the Dust</em> was published in 1939, the young novelist John Fante was living with his wife Joyce at 826 South Berendo.&nbsp; Today the story of Arturo Bandini and Camilla Lopez is widely considered the starting point of Los Angeles literature. If the abandoned apartment building where Fante realized his masterpiece is torn down and hauled away, the neighborhood will be removing an eyesore but the city will be losing a piece of its history. I join with all who urge that this site be recognized in some concrete and permanent way so as to preserve the memory of the incandescent time when John Fante called South Berendo home.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, just a few miles north, a short <a href="https://www.freedommag.org/english/canada/400m/page20.htm" target="_blank">portion</a> of Berendo has been renamed for another notable L.A. author, L. Ron Hubbard. It would be sweet if the same could one day be said of the 800 South block and Fante.</p>

<p>Lisa Sweetingham of CourtTV rode the Halloween Horrors Crime Bus, and reports in with a charming little feature she calls &quot;The bus ride to hell, and back.&quot;  </p>
<p>LOS ANGELES &mdash; &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, this tour should not be taken by anyone with a heart condition &#8230; We recommend you leave the bus immediately.&quot; A tour guide makes the announcement as the doors slam shut on our filled-to-capacity 56-seat cruising bus. We are rolling into Los Angeles noir, embarking on an exhaustive five-hour tour of grisly crime scenes and lesser Halloween hijinks from the &#8217;20s to the &#8217;50s.</p>
<p>The 1947project&#8217;s inaugural Halloween Horrors crime bus tour is touted as a BYOBB (Bring Your Own Barf Bag) event. And no children are allowed.</p>
<p>So why is there a clown breathing down my neck?</p>
<p>Crimebo the crime clown (aka Michael Perrick) bares his teeth and purrs in a gravelly voice as he walks down the aisle with a cauldron full of cheap candy, some shaped like eyeballs. &quot;Something sticky?&quot; he offers.</p>
<p>He pops a balloon animal and quips, &quot;These things just keep committing suicide.&quot;</p>

<p>April 8, 1907<br />
Los Angeles</p>
<p>R. Crawford Smith, a wealthy Cincinnati bachelor who died in February, aged 61, spent the past several years living amongst strangers in Los Angeles. For a long while, he called the Hotel Melrose on Grand Avenue his home, and more recently had lived with familes on McClintock Avenue and South Olive Street.</p>
<p>His two brothers, William E. and A. Denniston Smith, have come from the east after Crawford&#8217;s death to inquire how it is that his will, which was to have split his $100,000 fortune equally between them and two sisters, acquired late codiciles leaving $17,000 to three females, rumored to be practictioners of Spiritualism, all residents of this city. The Smiths have hired Attorney Charles Cassat Davis to handle the challenge.</p>
<p>E.Z. Barrett, husband of the woman willed $10,000, says his wife Dora befriended a sad old man, and was repaid for her kindness with the posthumous gift. Mediumship had nought to do with it&#8211;though Dora is a popular lecturer on the subject, who has been known to give public demonstrations of her ability to commune with those who have &#8220;passed over.&#8221; Mr. Barrett stresses however that Dora is not a medium of the typical type.</p>
<p>Pasadena high school teacher Miss Lottie Livingston was willed $5000 from the Smith coffers, and Mrs. Lola Swilling, whose husband is said to be an Army officer stationed in Cuba, has a $2000 gift promised her.</p>
<p>Smith&#8217;s few local friends recall him as a lonesome, ill and melancholy man, a believer in Spiritualism who sought out Mrs. Barrett and frequently visited her home in his last days, apologizing for being a burden but saying how much he appreciated being among friends.</p>
<p>The late man&#8217;s estate was largely held in property, including a hotel at the southeast corner of <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=S+Hope+St+%26+W+6th+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90017&amp;ll=34.050313,-118.256364&amp;spn=0.015076,0.041757" target="_blank">Hope and Sixth Streets</a> here.</p>
