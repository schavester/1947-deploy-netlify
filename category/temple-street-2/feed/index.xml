March 15, 1927<br />
Los Angeles</p>
<p>Traditionally, the term greengrocer refers to a retail tradesperson who sells fresh fruits and vegetables.  Should you be down on Temple Street, you might find grocer Edith Green to be a greengrocer of the green <em>meat</em> variety.  Mmmm.  Heck, even her Temple Street neighbor Abraham Margolis purveys criminally suspect comestibles.  </p>
<p>Edith, at 922 Temple, and Abraham, at 937, were both charged with selling adulterated and contaminated foodstuffs.  Stock amounting to $2,500 ($29,055 currentUSD) were ordered destroyed, she given thirty and he 180 days in the hoosegow, suspended on the condition that they clean up their act.  And their stores.</p>
<p>As much fun as it would be to venture in to those structures now to see what eighty year-old smells lingered from the putrid pigs feet and bad borscht, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to content ourselves with visualizing such while whizzing under the one-ten:<br />

<p>January 4, 1907<br />Los Angeles </p>
<p>Patrolman Sanders arrived at <a target="_blank" href="https://maps.yahoo.com/;_ylc=X3oDMTExNmIycG51BF9TAzI3MTYxNDkEc2VjA2ZwLWJ1dHRvbgRzbGsDbGluaw--#mvt=s&#038;q1=2521+west+temple+street%2C+los+angeles%2C+ca&#038;trf=0&#038;lon=-118.273664&#038;lat=34.072289&#038;mag=1">2521 West Temple Street</a> today to investigate complaints that a bull terrier had been a naughty dog.&nbsp; <img loading="lazy" width="400" height="127" border="0" align="right" title="doggie" alt="doggie" src="//farm1.static.flickr.com/165/345162403_703dfd371c_o.jpg" /></p>
<p>He was met at the house by a woman who insisted the dog was quite friendly and most quiet.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo; said the woman, who opened the door&hellip;and with one bound the pooch leapt upon the patrolman, tearing his coat sleeve and trouser leg.&nbsp; When Sanders drew his revolver, the fearless canine took the muzzle in his mouth and began a protracted game of tug o&rsquo; war with the interloper.</p>
<p>Sanders kicked the dog away, and the woman gathered the pup up in her arms and bore him away, weeping hysterically, crying &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you fired from the force you brute!&rdquo;&nbsp; To which the tattered Sanders replied &ldquo;Go ahead&mdash;do anything but please don&rsquo;t let that dog out again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Times does not report on any further outcome of this encounter.&nbsp;  <br />&nbsp; </p>
