<p>Gentle reader, </p>
<p>Although we selfishly wish you to stay here all day, frittering, may we nonetheless suggest a pair of historically-minded websites you might explore?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.backroadsofamericanmusic.com/" target="_blank">Backroads of American Music</a> operates from the charming supposition that&nbsp; the places where great music was made and heard, or where music makers broke bread, prayed or knocked their wives around, are worth visiting, photographing and talking about. Obviously, we quite <a href="https://www.esotouric.com/rock" target="_blank">agree</a>. The site is interactive, and welcomes your contributions and comments. </p>
<p><a href="https://bigorangelandmarks.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Big Orange Landmarks</a>, penned by the hirsute Floyd B. Bariscale, is one of those stunt blogs that the kids are all talking about. Only instead of cooking his way through the <em>Larousse Gastronomique</em> or eating nothing but peanut brittle and tracking the results, Floyd is working his way chronologically through the historic-cultural monuments of our great city, documenting the histories, providing new photographs, crowing when delighted and quite frankly stating his disappointment when the journey proves more than the destination. He&#8217;s up to #75, over on Carroll Avenue in Angelino Heights, but we&#8217;ll have to wait a while until he reaches&nbsp; <a href="https://www.you-are-here.com/victorian/grocery.html" target="_blank">Bob&#8217;s Market</a>, just steps away, but numbered 215. </p>

<p>Nick Santangelo saw my <a href="/?p=1546" target="_self">post</a> about the historic cobblestones exposed when Lincoln Heights was getting its roads repaved, and wanted to <a href="https://themistaken.com/UncoveredL.A..htm" target="_blank">share photos</a> of some of the brick streets and gutters in Highland Park and near Union Station. Some of these have already been covered over by insensitive city workers.</p>
<p><em>Nick says: The brick gutters on Avenues 41 and 45 (on North Figueroa) reminded me of Kim&#8217;s post. I have tried to get public works to stop paving over them as they are unique and historic but have not had any luck. I even sent some pics to the Highland Park Historical people but I never got a response. The new Homeboy Industries building near Phillipes sits next to a cobblestone street (Bruno, I think).<br /></em> </p>
<p>Sure, on a well travelled street it&#8217;s probably unreasonable to ask that archaic building materials bear the brunt of multi-ton SUVs&#8230; but can&#8217;t we somehow save the brick gutters in places where they&#8217;re still holding up so nicely?</p>

<p><em><strong>To buy a ticket on Sunday&#8217;s tour, click <a href="https://www.dumplinglab.com/crimebus/?q=pasadenaconfidentialaug6" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp; <br /> </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Location: You will be emailed directions to the tour start point soon after payment is received; include a phone number in the payment comments if you won&#8217;t be able to check your email, and we&#8217;ll call with details. </strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong /></em></p>
<p>About the tour: By popular demand, and following many nights terrifying ourselves reading grisly old news reports until falling into fitfull sleep, our <strong>Pasadena Confidential </strong>crime bus tour rolls on Sunday, August 6, from 10am-3pm. This five-hour luxury coach tour offers surprising insights into the often weird and horrible history of the Crown City, from the infamous to the forgotten. Tickets are $47 per person, and include cookies and home-made lemonade. </p>
<p>From celebrated cases like the RFK assassination (with a visit to Sirhan Sirhan&#8217;s folks&#8217; house), &quot;Eraserhead&quot; star Jack Nance&#8217;s strange end, black magician/rocket scientist Jack Parsons&#8217; death-by-misadventure and the 1926 Rose Parade grand stand collapse, to fascinating obscurities, the tour&#8217;s dozens of murders, arsons, kidnappings, robberies, suicides, auto wrecks and oddball happening sites provide a alternate history of Pasadena that&#8217;s as fascinating as it is creepy.</p>
<p> Crime Bus passengers will tour the old Millionaire&#8217;s Row on Orange Grove, thrill to the shocking Sphinx Murder on the steps of the downtown Masonic Hall, wonder about the unknown fiend who sneaked past a little girl to poison her father&#8217;s beer, discover why people named Judd should think twice before moving to Pasadena, and explore the racist spirit of the early 20th century through two forgotten stories: that of a Chinaman with leprosy whose suicide by hanging was treated as a novel entertainment by hundreds of citizens, and the case of wealthy mulatto Archie Hill, who shot a white trolley ticket-taker dead for shortchanging him.  </p>
<p>For more about this tour, see Patricia Jiayi Ho&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pasadenastarnews.com/news/ci_4085286">feature</a> in the Pasadena Star-News. To purchase a seat using a credit card, visit our <a href="https://www.dumplinglab.com/crimebus/?q=pasadenaconfidentialaug6" target="_blank">storefront</a>. Sorry, it is now too late to pay by check for Sunday&#8217;s tour.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em><strong><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Although it is extremely unlikely, the organizers reserve the right to postpone the tour in the event of extreme weather, riot, act of war or plague. Refunds may be available no more than 72 hours before the tour departs, and at the discretion of the organizers. You may substitute an alternate passenger&#8217;s name if you are unable to attend. We regret that there are no refunds for people who miss the bus. Potential passengers may call Kim at 323-223-2767 or email with any questions. </strong></em><strong><br /> </strong></strong></p>
