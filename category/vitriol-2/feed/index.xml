<p>Mrs. Nancy Parrish likes her palm tree.&nbsp; A lot.&nbsp; And who can blame her?&nbsp; This is Los Angeles.&nbsp; Palms define our city&mdash;in shape, in spirit, in soul.&nbsp; So when she looked out her window and saw someone digging up the palm in front of her home, <a title="courtst" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=West+Court+St,+90026&#038;sll=34.068729,-118.2622&#038;sspn=0.016424,0.029182&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.068196,-118.2622&#038;spn=0.016424,0.029182&#038;z=15&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1">419 Court Street</a>, she became enraged, and grabbed the 1927 version of pepper spray, a can of red pepper.&nbsp; She raced down the stairs and threw it full in the workers&rsquo; faces. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Never mind that it wasn&rsquo;t really her palm&mdash;Nancy&rsquo;s just a renter&mdash;she loved her palm, dammit.&nbsp; Of course that&rsquo;s no solace to poor Francisco Rodriquez, one of the diggers, who&rsquo;s facing the loss of his eyes, according to attendants at Receiving Hospital.&nbsp; Sidney Kanin, of 828 North Vermont, who&rsquo;d hired Rodriquez to help him dig out the palm, luckily turned his head in time to avoid the capsicum contents.&nbsp; Apparently Kanin had purchased the palm from Karl Vmorin, owner of Nancy&rsquo;s rentahouse. &nbsp;</p>
<p>After the attack, Kanin summoned policemen William Price and J. L. Willis to the scene, but they refused to arrest Mrs. Parrish; nosy neighbors are reporting that matter to Chief Davis.&nbsp; A complaint charging Parrish with battery and wrongful acts, and a warrant for her arrest, have since been issued by Chief Deputy City Prosecutor Concannon.</p>

<p>November 11, 1927<br />Los Angeles</p>
<p>Mrs. Marie Steen was minding her own beeswax tonight in her home at <a title="8619GS" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=8619+Grape+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90002&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=32.252269,59.765625&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=33.960501,-118.236322&#038;spn=0.00824,0.014591&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1">8619 Grape Street</a>, when a short, heavy-set man appeared at her door.&nbsp; He informed her that her husband had been in an accident, and that she&rsquo;d better board the eastbound <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=c6R3cHf1w5IC&#038;pg=PA24&#038;lpg=PA24&#038;dq=%22r+car%22+angeles&#038;source=web&#038;ots=1sdsrqIa39&#038;sig=5udlELyddDRA6Aym8J11R_fW3g0" target="_blank" title="RCarTortilaFlats">R car</a>, go to the end of the line and meet the man who&rsquo;d take her to her husband.&nbsp; Marie did as she was told, and at the end of the car line was met by a man in a new automobile who took her north on Eastern Avenue.&nbsp; When they reached an isolated spot, he, for reasons unknown, ripped her dress open at the neck, struck her over the head, and threw iodine in her face.</p>
<p>She was treated at Gardens Hospital and returned home.</p>
<p>Mrs. Steen certainly looks like she can take care of herself.&nbsp; On the other hand, Grape Street can be a pretty <a href="https://www.streetgangs.com/crips/grapestreet.html" target="_blank" title="grapestreet">rough place</a>.</p>
