<p>There&rsquo;s a knock on the door.&nbsp; Seems that Robert Seaner, the bondsman who&rsquo;d bailed Alice out when she got pinched for pickpocketing in downtown department stores, has just received some disturbing news from Chief of Police Laubenhemer out in Milwaukee.&nbsp; Was it true, Alice, that back in Milwaukee, where you were known as Mrs. Mary Becker, you escaped from the Industrial Home for Women at <a href="https://www.wi-doc.com/taycheed.htm" target="_blank" title="taycheedah">Taycheedah</a>?&nbsp; Would you be so kind as to come with me down to the station so we can sort this thing out?&nbsp; Sure thing, says Alice, let me go in the other room for a moment and change into my street clothes.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="126" height="221" border="0" align="right" title="alice" alt="alice" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1233/1078635841_aeaa75f201_o.gif" />But the moments come and go and the collected find the room empty.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s chosen death over jail:&nbsp; through the open window, they see her broken body lying four stories below.</p>
<p>Despite the basal skull fracture, broken nose and arm, and assorted internal injuries, Alice survives to stand trial.&nbsp; On November 26, Alice is freed on the charge of shoplifting, due to insufficient evidence; she is promptly rearrested by Milwaukee officers, who set off with their <a href="https://www.aclu.org/prison/women/25405prs20060502.html" target="_blank" title="backtohell">prisoner</a>.<br />&nbsp;<img loading="lazy" width="300" height="216" border="0" align="left" title="taycheedah" alt="taycheedah" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1311/1078635867_5fcf855b7b_o.gif" /></p>

<p>May 11, 1927<br />Los Angeles </p>
<p>Most liquor raids are tedious affairs, a pack of lit-up salesmen here, a couple sobbing college boys there. But once in a while, officers make a raid that&#8217;s just kind of special. </p>
<p>One such operation was on a blind pig at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=3120+South+Main+Street,+la,+ca&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=58.99189,105.644531&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.022147,-118.271255&#038;spn=0.007647,0.012896&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">3120 South Main Street</a>, allegedly run by Mrs. Ocio Walsh. Mrs. Walsh was taken into custody on charges of possession of liquor and contributing to the delinquency of a minor, while 38-year-old Frank Jones was charged with drunkenness and Robert Maschold, 37, with vagrancy.</p>
<p>That delinquency charge? See, Mrs. Walsh has a 14-year-old daughter, Mary Zella. Great kid, really <em>responsible</em>. When Sgt. Kynetto and Officers Wolf and Pound busted in they found a scantily-clad Mary Zella pouring a bottle of hooch down the sink. Mama sent her up to dress, the the clever minx hopped out a second story window and skedaddled. </p>
<p>Where&#8217;s she gone? Maybe back to the convent, from which Mama recently removed her to help out with the family business. Like I said, great kid.</p>
