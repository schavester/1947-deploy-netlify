<div align="left">Joe Pagglia had always wanted a pet monkey.&nbsp; His friends and neighbors told him, &quot;Joe, why not a kitty cat or a nice turtle?&nbsp; Monkeys may be cute, but they fling their poop.&nbsp; Who needs that?&quot;&nbsp; But Joe was undeterred, and was soon the proud owner of a monkey named Barney.&nbsp; As everybody knows, monkeys hate to be cooped up, so being a proud and good pet owner, Joe Pagglia took Barney downtown for a stroll.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in front of the under-construction City Hall, Barney slipped his rope leash and darted up a palm tree.&nbsp; As Joe and several others struggled to coax Barney down, a crowd of about 600 spectators gathered to cheer them on.&nbsp; Enjoying his audience, or perhaps terrified of them, Barney leaped 15 feet out of the palm tree, and made a dash for City Hall.&nbsp; He then proceeded to scale the building, and in three minutes, was sitting on the <a href="https://www.lacity.org/RESTORE/res_fh1cad.htm" target="_blank" title="lindberghbeacon">Lindbergh Beacon</a>.</p>
<p>Pagglia went up to the 28th floor, and cajoled Barney into position.&nbsp; Then, he made a lasso, tossed it over Barney&#8217;s head, cinched it around his belly and hoisted his simian friend into Daddy&#8217;s loving arms.&nbsp; The <em>Times</em> reported that &quot;hereafter, the monkey pet will occupy a cage in Pagglia&#8217;s backyard,&quot; which is terribly sad.&nbsp; But Barney seems like a crafty fellow &#8211; here&#8217;shoping he eventually made another break for it.</div>
