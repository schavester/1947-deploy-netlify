Venice</p>
<p>The twisted tale of Avalona Carnevale began last December 8, when the 30-year-old housewife from Venice made a phone call to her jeweler husband, Vincent. She couldn&#8217;t meet him in Los Angeles after all; he should take the street car home. And with that, she disappeared--dressed in what was described as an expensive fur coat and wearing $1800 worth of jewelry (almost $22,000 today). Vincent waited two weeks, then reported her missing, along with her car.</p>
<p>Police originally suspected foul play. Then, on January 13, the <i>Times</i> ran excerpts from a letter Avalona had written to her parents the previous week. &#8220;Honestly, Mama dear,&#8221; it read in part, &#8220;I have wanted so badly to let you know I am all right. As you know, I have been perfectly miserable the last few years and I was never contented. The climax came and I simply ran away from everything and everybody.&#8221; She was happy now, living in Long Beach with &#8220;a real he-man&#8221; named Bob. Bob, in turn, enclosed a note telling Avalona&#8217;s parents that she was &#8220;in safe and devoted hands.&#8221; </p>
<p>Happy, safe, devoted--it sounded perfectly peachy. Until today, that is, when Avalona made a statement to the police testifying that she had been lured from home by &#8220;a Barnes City circus employee&#8221; who kept her in such a state of constant intoxication that &#8220;she was by turns both unable and fearful to leave him.&#8221; It started with a few drinks in the circus man&#8217;s room. From there they went to a hotel in Culver City, where more alcohol was consumed. Her &#8220;mind was somewhat clouded from that moment on,&#8221; she told police, but her drinking buddy eventually pawned one of her bracelets for $25, which he then spent on liquor. They went to San Francisco and later to Oakland. Avalona didn&#8217;t contact police in those cities because the man beat her frequently, and she was afraid he would kill her if she tried to leave him. Eventually she did, seeking refuge in the home of Mr. and Mrs. A.M. Chisholm. Mr. Chisholm sent a telegram to Vincent Carnevale a week ago, informing him of his wife&#8217;s whereabouts. </p>
<p>That letter to her parents, the one telling them how happy she was with her &#8220;he-man&#8221; in Long Beach? Avalona told police she &#8220;faintly remembered&#8221; writing it. </p>
<p>Her husband retrieved her from Oakland (both the car and the jewels were gone) a few days ago. &#8220;She is my wife; she is in my home--that, I think is all the evidence you need of my intentions,&#8221; Vincent Carnevale told newsmen. </p>
<p>It was a noble sentiment, but it turned out that Carnevale had signed and sworn to a divorce complaint on January 31--the day after he received notice that his wife was in Oakland. But just as Avalona couldn&#8217;t quite remember writing that damning letter to her parents, Vincent was sketchy about the divorce papers, which were filed with the court on February 7--in error, according to Carnevale. &#8220;I did not mean to have the complaint filed,&#8221; he told the <i>Times</i>. &#8220;I&#8217;d forgotten all about it in my worry and joy at finding her [his errant missus] again. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, the matter is now a closed book.&#8221; </p>
<p>And so it remains.

<p>January 15, 1927<br />Los Angeles  </p>
<p>The body of a young man, dressed in sailor&#8217;s togs, was found today by four children playing in an open field near <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=eighteenth+street+and+point+view+avenue,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=50.37814,103.710938&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.045246,-118.372514&#038;spn=0.00649,0.01266&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="Von Bulo's body found">Eighteenth Street and Point View Avenue</a>. The youngsters reported their gruesome discovery to the police, who identified the man as Henry Von Bulo.   </p>
<p>Von Bulo was the third member of a love triangle gone tragically wrong. (Do they ever end happily?) Last month, Curran C. Samuels, age 40, shot his wife, then turned the gun on himself. He died. The missus, though pierced by a bullet that entered her ear and exited her mouth, survived. While in the hospital, Mrs. Samuels told detectives that her husband had probably killed her friend, Henry Von Bulo. She even led them on an unsuccessful search of the vicinity in which his body was eventually found. Mrs. Samuels believes that Von Bulo was killed on December 15, as he did not keep an appointment in Long Beach on that day. Three days later, Mr. Samuels shot his wife near <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=Rossmore+Avenue+and+Wilshire+Boulevard,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=34.045246,-118.372514&#038;sspn=0.00649,0.01266&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.063432,-118.327646&#038;spn=0.006488,0.01266&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="Mrs. Samuels shot near here">Rossmore Avenue and Wilshire Boulevard</a> &quot;where she was engaged as a box-lunch saleswoman.&quot;   </p>
<p>Despite the fact that Von Bulo was dressed in sailor&#8217;s clothing and Mrs. Samuels&#8217;s assertion that he was a member of the merchant marine, Von Bulo&#8217;s stepfather declared that the young man had purchased the uniform and shoes last month in Oakland. He also suggested that his stepson might be the victim of a &quot;bootlegger&#8217;s war,&quot; but declined to further elaborate.  </p>

Los Angeles</p>
<p>Yesterday&#8217;s news told of poison booze victim <a href=" /deathpotion">Dennis Cavanaugh</a>. Now it looks like everybody&#8217;s trying to get into the act. Take, for example, Mrs. Helen Delamere, who in court papers filed today claims that her husband, P.F. Delamere, has been trying to poison her for several years. First there was the time he tried to get her to eat some poisoned pie. Mrs. Delamare&#8217;s nurse wouldn&#8217;t let her-but when the nurse ate it (waste not, want not!), she became ill. When on several occasions Mrs. Delamere consumed chicken and soup prepared by her hubby, sickness followed. And when Mrs. D, her sister, and mother nibbled on sandwiches made by the sinister Mr. D--you guessed it--the ladies were seized by illness. </p>
<p>Even Aimee Semple McPherson has been gripped by the poison fad. Suspicion was aroused today when a man hurried into a downtown messenger bureau carrying a brown package tied with purple string addressed to the evangelist and marked &#8220;rush delivery.&#8221;  The man then refused to leave the office until the package was dispatched. Due to his erratic behavior, the delivery service sent a messenger boy out with the package, but instructed him to double around the block. The sender (who paid in cash and did not state his name) followed awhile, then disappeared. In the interim, the police were called. </p>
<p>The officers immediately suspected &#8220;an infernal machine,&#8221; but when the package and a burning dynamite cap were placed side by side, nothing happened. The cops thereupon opened the box and discovered it was filled with candied figs-sweetmeats now suspected of being poisoned. They await analysis by the city chemist.

<p>December 4, 2007<br />Los Angeles  </p>
<p>Like many people, Mr. and Mrs. Harry Franklin of <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=181+griffith+avenue,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=57.162571,106.875&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.026201,-118.256922&#038;spn=0.029592,0.052185&#038;z=14&#038;iwloc=cent&#038;om=1" target="_blank">181 Griffith Avenue</a> like to have a little nip now and then, a simple pleasure made exceedingly difficult these dry days. Of course, there are ways of getting around the Volstead Act, but these often prove risky. Just what the cops were doing in the Franklin family bathroom on November 2, the <em>Times</em> didn&#8217;t reveal, but the lawmen discovered eleven pints of whisky there.   </p>
<p>This week, the Franklins came before Municipal Judge Sheldon. In an unusual move, Ludie Franklin, Harry&#8217;s wife, asked to be substituted for her husband as the defendant in the case. Harry, it seems, had already been twice convicted on liquor charges. If found guilty a third time, the judge could send him up the river for year or two. Judge Sheldon agreed to this novel plan and Ludie went before the jury, who found her guilty as charged and sentenced her to forty days in the clink. Let&#8217;s hope Harry had a nice, dry celebration for her when she got out.  </p>

<p>September 4, 1927<br />Los Angeles  </p>
<p>The public stenographer was used to all sorts of crazy jobs, but the one that arrived in the mail last week was a new one for sure. She was to type up, and send to a number of prominent citizens, an appeal for $1500 from a purportedly destitute woman who promised to kill herself if the money was not received by the following Wednesday. The letter was signed &ldquo;Madame XYZ.&rdquo; It was all too weird for the stenographer, who turned the request over to police.  </p>
<p>Today, an anonymous note showed up at the <a title="L.A. Central Police Station, 1938" target="_blank" href="https://jpg2.lapl.org/pics04/00011777.jpg">Central Police Station</a> identifying Madame XYZ as Eunice McMullin of <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=2674+South+Vermont+Avenue,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=29.219963,59.765625&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.03159,-118.291533&#038;spn=0.007451,0.014591&#038;z=16&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="Madame XYZ's house">2674 South Vermont Avenue</a>. Clues given in the note led detectives to the conclusion that McMullin is really Mrs. Frank A. Martin. The 40-year-old Mrs. Martin has been missing since last week, according to her husband, who also said she tried to kill herself three years ago in Oakland.   </p>
<p>XYZ/McMullin/Martin was clearly no criminal mastermind; the note, which used her real address, also included details of a railroad accident Martin suffered in 1913. And asking a public stenographer to send her extortion letters? Pure bush league.   </p>
<p><em>Postscript</em>:  Police closed the case the following day, after the still-missing Madame XYZ contacted her husband and promised not to take her own life. Detectives noted that Mr. Martin was &ldquo;not at all concerned&rdquo; over his wife&rsquo;s threats of suicide (an attitude apparently shared by the LAPD where Madame XYZ&rsquo;s attempt at blackmail was concerned).   </p>
<p>His wife wanted the money, Mr. Martin revealed to the <em>Times</em>, to &ldquo;establish a new religious movement.&rdquo; Neighbors, on the other hand, reported that they hadn&rsquo;t noticed an upsurge in religious activities by either of the Martins, who were &ldquo;in a strained financial condition&rdquo;&mdash;or so said the neighborhood busybodies.  </p>
<p>The story ended two days later, when Madame XYZ dropped a letter in her husband&rsquo;s mailbox stating she would return to him only if he joined her in founding her sect. Alas, no details were given concerning the new religion, and, as police reiterated, given Mr. Martin&rsquo;s &ldquo;confidence that no harm will befall his wife,&rdquo; the case was at a standstill.  </p>
