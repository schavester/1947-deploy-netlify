<div><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://www.lmharnisch.com/images/1907_0113B.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 354px; height: 90px;" src="//www.lmharnisch.com/images/1907_0113B.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />
<span style="font-size:100%;">Jan. 13, 1907<br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;">Los Angeles<br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;">The Times takes a light, humorous look at the destructive wanderings of Eaton Wash: a docile stream, if not entirely dry, most of the year, turned into a churning monster by heavy rains.<br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;">Ã¢â‚¬Å“The little river that makes so much trouble lives somewhere in the fastness of EatonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Canyon during the summer months,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times says. Ã¢â‚¬Å“In the rainy season it always comes prowling out for a wild outing.<br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://www.lmharnisch.com/images/1907_0113C.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 218px; height: 592px;" src="//www.lmharnisch.com/images/1907_0113C.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;">Ã¢â‚¬Å“Not having a respectable bed like other rivers, it comes bursting down from the mountains and goes wherever anyone will let it go.<br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;">Ã¢â‚¬Å“When the rains began this year, it stole trustfullyÃ¢â‚¬”undiscouraged by its previous disappointmentsÃ¢â‚¬”down from the mountains.<br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;">Ã¢â‚¬Å“It sneaked on a pleasant-looking ranch in the valley. And the farmer found it thereÃ¢â‚¬”as it covered about half his ranchÃ¢â‚¬”and rushed out with shovels and teams and turned it back on someone elseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ranch.<br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;">Ã¢â‚¬Å“And the ranchman who owns this second ranch on which it was driven came out in a rage and shook his fist, bellowing: Ã¢â‚¬ËœHere, come and take back your old river. It canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stay on my place.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ And he said other things.Ã¢â‚¬Â<br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;">The engineers of the Southern Pacific railroad built a massive culvert to protect the tracks from washing out. But another neighbor, Annie Adams, hired men to turn the fences on her 36-acre ranch into a barrier.<br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;">Ã¢â‚¬Å“The only way for the river to get on Miss AdamsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ranch was to jump the fence,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times says.<br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;">Ã¢â‚¬Å“Anyone familiar with the eccentricities [of the river] can guess readily enough what happened then,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times says. Ã¢â‚¬Å“That fine and elegant new culvert of the railroad company lasted about a minute.Ã¢â‚¬Â<br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;">More men and teams of horses built a barrier of sandbags to stop the river. Ã¢â‚¬Å“It went. It rippled forlornly down the side of the high embanked track trying to find a hole through the sandbag dikeÃ¢â‚¬”but  nothing doing.<br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;">Ã¢â‚¬Å“Then it came to a long, hard, fascinating looking strip of road leading through the middle of the little town of Savannah. It turned down this road with a little gurgle of joy,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times says.<br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;">Ã¢â‚¬Å“And the things that it did to that county road is enough to make the county supervisors weep in anguish.<br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;">Ã¢â‚¬Å“It was a beautiful oiled roadÃ¢â‚¬”smooth and flat and even. The river gouged out chuckholes as deep as a well. It made ruts in which you could drydock a ship. It ruined several hundred dollarsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ worth of highway in less time than it takes to write it.Ã¢â‚¬Â<br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;">Lawsuits followed and a committee was appointed to pick a course for the river. But none of the ranchers wanted the river on his property.<br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;">Ã¢â‚¬Å“In the end, the court will undoubtedly select a straight, direct route, with the proper angle and fall and slope from the canyon to the river, and order a right of way condemnedÃ¢â‚¬”let it cross whose ranch it may,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times says.</p>
<p>Bonus factoid: The story uses the phrase &#8220;No. 23 skiddoo,&#8221; which I&#8217;ve always associated with the 1920s. Apparently  the anonymous writer was ahead of his time.<br />

<span style="font-size:100%;">Water is not the only thing that flows downhill, as switchmen at the downtown Southern Pacific freight yard discovered when two runaway flatcars made a 13-mile trip from the San Fernando Valley in 10 minutes.<br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;">Although the runaway cars sent people scrambling as they crossed the tracks, there were no trains running at the time, so a serious accident was avoided.<br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;">The flatcars, part of a gravel-hauling operation in  Roscoe [Sun Valley], inexplicably came loose and had a four-mile downhill start before blazing through the Burbank station. The Burbank operator sent warning ahead that he saw something rip past</div>
