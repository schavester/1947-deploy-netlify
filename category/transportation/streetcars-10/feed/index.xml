Los Angeles</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s how The Times weather stories read a century ago: </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ã¢â‚¬Å“For all the daylight hours yesterday, the rain drizzled down, much of the time like a heavy Scotch mist, but toward nightfall the storm deepened and the rain began to fall in earnest. For two hours in the early part of the night there was a constant downpour that soon set the gutters running full and brought about the usual results to the streets near the hill district.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ã¢â‚¬Å“The wash from the highways intersecting the hills poured down onto the streets of the business section and deposits of sand and gravel caused much inconvenience to electric cars. At several of the intersections on Broadway and Hill streets, men were stationed with shovels to keep the tracks passable for cars.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ã¢â‚¬Å“The rain disarranged schedules for several of the car lines and much trouble was experienced on both the Belt line and the Brooklyn Avenue line to get the cars around the numerous curves overwashed with gravel.Ã¢â‚¬Â</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ã¢â‚¬Å“No special damage was done by the storm in Garvanza, although the streets were cut up in some cases. At Highland Park, a swift current flowed down Pasadena Avenue, cutting that street badly in several places.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ã¢â‚¬Å“Right in the midst of yesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rain, a water pipe on Broadway in front of the Ville de Paris broke and when workmen made excavations to mend the pipe, the water got beyond control and shot up into the air on a level with the fourth story of the building. Hundreds of pedestrians stopped in the rain to watch the great fountain play and it added much to the waters rushing down the street.Ã¢â‚¬Â</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Normally, I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like to merely copy what ran in The Times, but sometimes itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impossible to rewrite the stories and preserve the original flavor. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The raft tipped, The Times says, sending 8-year-old Clarence Rhodes of 1004 S. Jasmine tumbling into the water. Hearing the boysÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ cries for help, M. Allen rushed from his home at 922 Normandie, plunged into the water and rescued Clarence. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After nearly half an hourÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work, the boy was resuscitated, The Times says. </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;" class="MsoNormal">Abandoned Boy</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ã¢â‚¬Å“His mother dead and deserted by his father, Charlie McDaniel, 6 years of age, has been wandering about the city, picking up a living as best he could, and sleeping in dry goods boxes and nooks and corners,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times says. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The boy was found early yesterday morning by a patrolman and he is now in the Detention Home.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ã¢â‚¬Å“In telling his pitiful story at the Central Station, the boy said that his mother died a few months ago and that his father had gone away with some woman. The police will make an effort to locate the father.Ã¢â‚¬Â</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;" class="MsoNormal">Last Stop</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Mrs. A.C. Newton of 2707 Central Ave. is not expected to live after fracturing her skull when she leaped from a speeding streetcar because it passed her stop.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ã¢â‚¬Å“According to witnesses, Mrs. Newton asked to be allowed to leave the car at 29<sup>th</sup> Street. When she saw the coach was running past the street, she jumped. The car crew carried her into a house nearby,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times says. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ã¢â‚¬Å“Several passengers on the car said that it was No. 419. They state that the conductor paid no attention to Mrs. NewtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s signals.Ã¢â‚¬Â </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Note: I was amazed to learn just how many people were injured in 1907 by jumping from streetcars that failed to stop. Without checking further, I would say someone was hurt about once a week. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Bonus fact: The local tourism industry is furious because the state Senate passed the <a href="https://pensive-torvalds-020d34.netlify.app/centennial-ramblings">bill banning horses with docked tails</a>. Businesses note that wealthy visitors from the East often bring their teams to Los Angeles at great expense and if their fancy horses are prohibited, wealthy tourists will avoid the Southland in favor of Florida. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">One thing you can say about Angelenos: We love to talk about traffic. The only thing we love more is to commission studies and draft plans to deal with the problem, and then ignore them. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ã¢â‚¬Å“With the wonderful growth of Los Angeles as a great city has come to it many problems to be solved. The Owens River and the system of storm drains underway are the solutions of two important ones,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times says.</p>
<p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://www.lmharnisch.com/images/1907_0127B.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 344px; height: 212px;" src="//www.lmharnisch.com/images/1907_0127B.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:130%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A traffic jam in 1907</span></span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ã¢â‚¬Å“But now the city is face to face with another important problem, that of the congestion of its streets in the business section, especially by the electric car traffic, which at certain times of the day causes blockades, loss of time to thousands, loss of business to merchants and discomfort to the public.Ã¢â‚¬Â</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now this is painful reading:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;" class="MsoNormal">Ã¢â‚¬Å“This problem of transportation will grow in importance every year during which it is neglected. Swift as has been the extension and shifting of lines of the great electric railway system in and about Los Angeles, the city has grown with still greater rapidity.Ã¢â‚¬Â</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://www.lmharnisch.com/images/1907_0127A.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 350px; height: 346px;" src="//www.lmharnisch.com/images/1907_0127A.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:130%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The elevated train proposed for Los Angeles and never built.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Times says Henry Huntington plans to build an experimental elevated line from the Pacific Electric Building south on Tennessee with the idea of eventually linking to the beach cities. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ã¢â‚¬Å“To ride on such a railway, above the smells and dust of the streets, will some day be a delight to the citizens of Los Angeles, if ideas now if the mind of the great railroad builder are carried out.Ã¢â‚¬Â</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sixty years ago, we again failed to address the problem of transportation, from the blogÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s archives for September 1947:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Someday an inquisitive person studying the history of transportation and urban planning will tell the world exactly what became of Los AngelesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ 1947 blueprint for dealing with transit problems. In the meantime, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to settle for the knowledge that at least they made a valiant effort. They certainly knew what was comingÃ¢â‚¬â€without much argument, you could call them futurists.</p>
<p>A committee sponsored by the California Chamber of Commerce spent 19 months studying transportation issues and warned that someday Los Angeles would have a population of 5 million (the 2000 population of Los Angeles County was 9,519,338, with 3,694,820 for the city of L.A.).</p>
<p>Ã¢â‚¬Å“High-speed rail transit arteries plus a system of downtown subways alone can save Los Angeles from disintegration into a hodge-podge of unconnected municipalities,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times said in quoting the projectÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s advocates.</p>
<p>Ã¢â‚¬Å“Crux of this preliminary proposal lies in the immediate revamping of express highway projects (today we call them freeways) to include Ã¢â‚¬Ëœcenter stripÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ tracks capable of whisking trains at 35 to 50 mph.</p>
<p>Ã¢â‚¬Å“These cars, pouring millions of commuters daily into metropolitan Los Angeles, would unload at special downtown stations whence passengers would be shuttled to local destinations by subways tentatively scheduled under Broadway and Spring Street.</p>
<p>Ã¢â‚¬Å“The master plan envisions center strip tracks on the Hollywood, Santa Monica, Olympic, Inglewood, Harbor and East Bypass Freeways.Ã¢â‚¬Â</p>
<p>The Times notes: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Eventually the master plan would integrate all forms of mass transportation, including operation of rubber-tired vehicles on certain expressways not immediately requiring trains.Ã¢â‚¬Â</p>
<p>A quick search through Proquest isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t helpful in determining the projectÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fate. William Jeffers, the former Union Pacific railroad president who was to be a consultant on the project, is quoted in 1948 calling for approval of a rapid transit district.</p>
<p>Of course there was a competing proposal. The 1948 Babcock plan, named for consulting engineer Henry A. Babcock, who envisioned a 650-mile subway system at a cost of $1,100,000,000 ($10,410,604,566.50 USD 2005). While there were arguments between the two factions, in the end, neither plan was adopted, as any Los Angeles driver knows.</p>
<p>The original story reveals some obvious clues as to why: The Inglewood, Olympic and East Bypass Freeways arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t familiar names these days. One could paper the dining room with Times maps of various freeway routes that were never built. (In simple terms, the Santa Monica Freeway was originally envisioned much farther north. To the south, the Olympic Freeway was to go from the Harbor Freeway to Venice and the Inglewood Freeway was to go from the Harbor Freeway to Sepulveda).</p>
<p>And there are other stories in the same issue that offer more hints: A huge petition drive led by Ted Meltzer, publisher of the South Side Journal, against building the Harbor Freeway between Broadway and Figueroa. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Homeowners in an area bounded by 23rd Street and Imperial Boulevard claim that several thousand homes in the built-up area would be destroyed and ask that the project be either abandoned or postponed,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times said. And an adjoining story reports on a seven-month investigation of graft and conspiracy in acquiring property for the Hollywood Freeway.</p>
<p>But it is gratifying when wondering what became of the 1947 plan to remember that the new Gold Line tracks run between lanes of the Foothill Freeway. Some things just take time.</p>
<p>Bonus factoid: The Harbor Freeway was realigned to spare the Auto Club headquarters on South Figueroa and USCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fraternity Row.</p>
