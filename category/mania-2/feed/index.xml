Los Angeles</p>
<p>Not every L.A. woman has the chance to be wooed by royalty, but Mrs. Edith Brown of <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=4720+Mascot+Street,+los+angeles,+ca&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=33.901528,79.277344&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.041512,-118.342474&amp;spn=0.008659,0.019355&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr" target="_blank">4720 Ã‚Â½ Mascot Street</a> proved singularly unimpressed by the stream of letters emanating from the pen of Lionel I, self-proclaimed King of America. The lady, apparently a democrat, called the cops. They took His Majesty (otherwise known as Lionel Craviato) before the judge, who sent the regal fellow off to City Jail to learn that even a king should not annoy a lady. </p>
<p>An excerpt from one of the offending missives read: &quot;All the American army and navy love me and they recognize me as their first chief and want me to be king of their country. I will conquer and civilize the whole world!&quot;</p>
<p>Hmm, maybe the problem was that this would-be king never learned how to write a proper love letter. Lionel, Lionel, Lionel, no woman wants to read about how much the <em>army</em> loves you! Also, for future reference, we like rubies.

<p class="MsoNormal">March 7, 1907<br />
Los Angeles</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A dreadful disease called acute glanders has been discovered in a horse and veterinarian R.J. Ramage ordered that the animal be destroyed immediately. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In addition to rapidly causing death, acute glanders can be spread from <a href="https://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Glanders">horses to humans</a> and there is no known cure, at least in 1907. Apparently several men in Los Angeles County died of acute glanders in 1893.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Since glanders is often found in horsesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ nasal passages, local veterinarians want to ban wooden water troughs from city streets, saying that they are a breeding ground for the disease. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In 1911, Pasadena authorities ordered that 14 horses owned by the Pasadena Ice Co. be shot to death because they had the disease. The county veterinarian also quarantined a stable occupied by a dozen horses and Ã¢â‚¬Å“a number of ChineseÃ¢â‚¬Â after detecting acute glanders.<span style="">  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ã¢â‚¬Å“The disease is so infectious that it can be contracted by a horse sneezing in oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eye,Ã¢â‚¬Â said county Veterinarian W.B. Rowland. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In 1909, Ramage, of 831 S. Los Angeles St.,<span style="">  </span>went on a violent rampage at the Alpine Tavern on Mt. Lowe and it took 11 men to get him under control. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ã¢â‚¬Å“At the tavern, the man created notice by talking continually to himself and created a disturbance by falling on his knees in the ashes of the fireplace; bowing his head down almost to the embers and offering violent words of prayer,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times says. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ã¢â‚¬Å“Two physicians, formerly of the Southern California Hospital for the Insane at Patton, happened to be present and, taking ropes which were brought, demonstrated that they knew how to handle a crazy man.Ã¢â‚¬Â </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After being taken to Pasadena, Ramage was put in a car for the ride to the county hospital. Ã¢â‚¬Å“All the way to Los Angeles, the unfortunate man screamed and struggled, endeavoring to throw himself from the swiftly moving machine,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times says.<span style="">  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Eventually, Ramage recovered and told hospital attendants that he had been suffering from mania for years. Ã¢â‚¬Å“He had only a dim recollection of the trouble he went through there.Ã¢â‚¬Â</p>
