										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="body">
<div>March 19, 1927<br />
Long Beach, CA</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="//farm4.static.flickr.com/3103/2345049446_6a45978606_m.jpg" alt="longbeachshooting" width="240" height="217" align="left" />Fred and Lela McElrath had been married for 25 years, and raised three children together, now grown.  But just as the couple should have been settling down into contented empty nesthood, a violent disagreement nearly destroyed it all.</p>
<p>Fred wanted to leave Long Beach for Freewater, Oregon, where they owned a ranch; however, Lela was determined to stay put.  She moved out of their home at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=45+atlantic+avenue,+los+angeles,+ca&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=29.219963,59.765625&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=33.769462,-118.185081&amp;spn=0.007474,0.014591&amp;z=16" target="_blank" title="atlantic">45 Atlantic Avenue</a>, and Fred spent nearly a week trying to track her down.  On March 18, they finally agreed to meet at a neutral location, their daughter&#8217;s home at 32 Neptune Place, and try to talk things through.</p>
<p>However, Lela refused to reconsider, and walked away from the argument.  As she was descending the stairs in her daughter&#8217;s house, Fred pulled out a gun and shot her twice in the back before turning the gun on himself, firing into his mouth.  The shots didn&#8217;t kill Lena, and when she was admitted to Seaside Hospital, it was assumed that she would recover.  However, Fred was barely clinging to life, and in fact, police arriving on the scene initially believed him dead.</p>
<p>Today, things looked drastically different.  A bullet was lodged behind Fred&#8217;s left ear, but doctors expected that he would make a full recovery &#8212; and in all likelihood, be left to stand trial for his wife&#8217;s murder.  The shots fired into his wife&#8217;s back had punctured her right lung, and she was not expected to live.  Authorities stood watch at Fred&#8217;s bed, waiting to charge him either with murder or attempted murder.</p>
<p>Shockingly, the story has a moderately happy ending.  On April 11, a frail Lena McElrath, appeared at her husband&#8217;s preliminary hearing and was helped to the stand by her son, where she made an impassioned plea on Fred&#8217;s behalf.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not want to testify against my husband, nor do I want him prosecuted.  I believe our trouble was caused as much by me as by my husband.  I want to go back to him and begin all over.&quot;</p>
<p>Judge Stephen G. Long agreed she should have that chance, saying, &quot;This is a very remarkable affair, but if both parties are willing to forgive and forget and to endeavor to patch up their broken lives, I think the kindest thing for this court to do is to give McElrath a chance.&quot;</p>
<p>The charge was dismissed, and the McElraths left the courtroom with their arms wrapped around each other.  Lena&#8217;s wounds were expected to heal completely with time, though Fred would be forever incapacitated by the bullet, still lodged near his spine.</p></div>

<div align="left">A gory scene unfolded at the Venice Police Station today as 23-year-old Eddie Berry burst through the front door with a slit throat and passed out on the floor.</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">An employee of the Venice Speedboat Company, Berry had been working on the Venice Pier when he was accosted by a woman packing a knife in her handbag. &nbsp; The dame was Berry&#8217;s sweet wife.&nbsp; She began to argue with him, then drew out her knife and slashed him across the throat, narrowly missing his jugular vein.</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">Berry was taken to the emergency room for stitches, while police went out in search of the estranged wife.&nbsp; However, the search was later dropped when Berry refused to press charges.</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">Okay, it&#8217;s not much of a Halloween story, but it was this or the story of a few rowdy teens from the Redlands being sent to a YWCA dance to keep them from vandalizing property.&nbsp; Plus, isn&#8217;t &quot;The Venice Slasher&quot; a great name for a would-be murderess?</div>

<p style="font-weight: bold;" class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Led by I. Newerf and J.B. Dudley, the automobile owners of Los Angeles are fighting a new city ordinance that bans parking within 40 feet of downtown<span style="">  </span>intersections. Newerf, the West Coast representative of Goodyear Tire Co., and Dudley, a car salesman, received citations for violating the law and have pleaded not guilty.<span style="">  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In April 1909, Dudley pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter after hitting street inspector Woodman J. Thomas on Broadway near 5<sup>th</sup> Street. He was sentenced to five yearsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ probation in March 1910. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Hazel La Doux, a.k.a. Hazel Rogers, hid her face with a veil as she was tried on charges of forgery. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ã¢â‚¬Å“Her downfall is said to be due to a man named William Rogers, an alleged Ascot tout who deserted her,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times says. Ã¢â‚¬Å“It is charged that Miss La Doux forged the name of Mrs. John Brink on a check for $120 and cashed it.Ã¢â‚¬Â </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">La Doux told police that she and Rogers used a scheme in which she took a job with a reputable employer and passed clientsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ information to her lover. La Doux said she worked at a department store in Oakland and a dentistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s office in Los Angeles, turning over names to Rogers, who forged the checks. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ã¢â‚¬Å“She had been an honest woman, she said, until RogersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ oily tongue and smooth ways captivated her and she became his mistress and then a thief,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times says. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;" class="MsoNormal">He Paid $40</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Restaurant owner Frank Flood stood over his wife, Annie, as she lay on the floor of their quarters at a Spring Street rooming house and said it would be worth the $25 fine just so he could beat her up. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In testifying against him, Ã¢â‚¬Å“She recited a story of shocking cruelty, saying that she had been mistreated, scorned and finally beaten by the man who promised to love, cherish and protect her,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times says. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Flood did not dispute any of the charges, refused to cross-examine her (a husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right in those days) and pleaded guilty to battery. Ã¢â‚¬Å“He admitted that he struck her and confessed to having assaulted her with his fist as she lay on the floor,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times says. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He paid $40 ($837.08 USD 2005). </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Flood skipped town in September 1907. Ã¢â‚¬Å“He made the acquaintance of a fast sot and spent plenty of money, too much, in fact, for a man of his means. Late suppers at swell cafes cost Flood much cash. Then he became possessed of a desire to take long journeys in touring cars. He paid his bills with other peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s money, the new restaurant manager says, by levying on the cash drawer of the restaurant, which is owned by a company,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times says.<span style="">  </span></p>
