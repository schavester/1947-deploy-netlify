<p>We&#8217;re very happy to announce that the best of issue of the <a href="http://www.downtownnews.com/articles/2007/07/23/news/news04.txt" target="_blank">Downtown News</a> is on the stands, and Esotouric has been named Best Tours. </p>
<blockquote><p>In 2005, Kim Cooper, Larry Harnisch and Nathan Marsak created the 1947project, a blog that chronicled a different L.A. crime for each day of that year. The project was such a success that they followed up with a similar blog detailing the sordid affairs of 1907 and 1927. Now, Cooper and others lead excursions for a tour bus company called Esotouric. The four- or five-hour adventures canvass the city, highlighting crime sites from the heinous to the quirky. This summer, Esotouric debuted &quot;John Fante&#8217;s Dreams of Bunker Hill,&quot; which visited the Downtown haunts of Arturo Bandini, the protagonist of Fante&#8217;s 1939 novel <em>Ask the Dust.</em> In August, don&#8217;t miss the Charles Bukowski birthday tour, which celebrates what would have been the author&#8217;s 87th birthday. At esotouric.com<em>.-LL</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Well, if the Downtown News thinks we&#8217;re doing something right with our Black Dahlia, John Fante and other downtown-centered tours, the least we can do to say thanks is to offer two new bus tours celebrating the neighborhood as it was in the wild old days. </p>
<p>So on September 8, we&#8217;ll launch our first 90-minute Crime Bus tours, the back-to-back <a href="http://www.esotouric.com/hotelhorrors-sept8" target="_blank">Hotel Horrors</a> and <a href="http://www.esotouric.com/mainstreetvice-sept8" target="_blank">Main Street Vice</a>, with a cocktail/snack break between. You can ride one for $25 or both for $45, and we hope the lower price and shorter running time will be an opportunity for folks who&#8217;ve been wanting to ride for a while to join us. See you on the bus!</p>

<p>Gentle rider,  </p>
<p>The Crime Bus Tour will ride again in September and October, and while final details are still being worked out before we can begin selling tickets, we are accepting pre-reservations to make it easier for interested passengers to fit us into their schedules. </p>
<p>Note that our regular 5 hour Crime Bus tours cost $47, but it is possible that the Dahlia tour will be both shorter and less expensive. </p>
<p>The upcoming tours are as follows:  </p>
<p>1) The Real Black Dahlia, Saturday 9/16 and perhaps also Sunday 9/17 (to coincide with opening weekend of the Black Dahlia film), in which we will visit many of the places Elizabeth Short actually frequented during her time in Los Angeles, including the spot where her body was found. The tour also includes scenes familiar from many of the weird theories surrounding her death, and a presentation by myself and Nathan on Dr. Walter Bayley, the only viable suspect ever proposed by a crime researcher, our 1947project colleague Larry Harnisch. </p>
<p>2) Halloween Horrors, Saturday 10/21, our darkest tour yet, featuring the most horrible, weird and disturbing stories uncovered in our researches. This tour is not recommended for children or the faint of heart, and you might want to bring your own barf bag. </p>
<p>If interested in either tour, please <a href="http://www.47upgradepath7.richardschave.com//feedback" target="_blank">email me</a> with your name, phone number, and number of tickets desired. For the Dahlia tour, note if you can attend Saturday, Sunday or either. This does not obligate you to buy tickets, but you&#8217;ll get first crack at them when they are available. If it&#8217;s the Pasadena Confidential tour you wish to ride, let me know, as it will give us an idea of the demand and help determine when to schedule the next run.</p>
