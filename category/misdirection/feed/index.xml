<p>Trick or treat&#8230; or how&#8217;s about a smattering of hammer blows about the head? </p>
<p>Such was the reward for would-be good Samaritan C.P. Kirsch, who picked up a shabby fellow who was hobbling along on crutches in the darkness beyond the Adams Street train line. The guest sat in back with Kirsch&#8217;s mother-in-law Edith Kneale, and once they were underway, pulled out a hammer and began hitting Mr. Kirsch over the head&mdash;but rather gently, since Kirsch turned around and fought back, chasing the would-be slayer away with his crutches under his arm. The victim and Mrs. Kneale both reside at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=2353+West+29th+Place,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=58.555544,99.492187&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.029225,-118.319514&#038;spn=0.007593,0.012145&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">2353 West 29th Place</a>.</p>
<p>And on the subject of folks hit over the head with more accuracy, <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7073241.stm" target="_blank">R.I.P. Linda Stein</a>. The Ramones curse strikes again.</div>
