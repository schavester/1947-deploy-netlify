Los Angeles</p>
<p>Police are searching for &#8220;bandit queen&#8221; Rose Berk with renewed effort after today&#8217;s arrest of one of her henchmen, Fred J. Cook. Berk (aka Rose Buckingham, aka Rose Burke) is suspected of masterminding more than half a dozen &#8220;feminine lure&#8221; robberies during the last week alone. During the course of these hold-ups, Berk pretended to be a helpless female seeking &#8220;assistance in starting a stalled automobile.&#8221; She was perhaps particularly suited to this role because, &#8220;unlike the usual type&#8221; of bandit queen, Berk was described by police as &#8220;homely, awkward in her manner and so old-fashioned that she still wears her hair long.&#8221; </p>
<p>However out of style she may have been, Berk evaded capture by the L.A.P.D. On April 13, 1927, she was behind the wheel of the getaway car when a group of hold-up men, Fred Cook among them, robbed the Seaboard National Bank on Wilshire Boulevard of $21,000. The hapless Cook was arrested two years later, when in August 1929, he was recognized on a visit to Rose Berk, then jailed in Indianapolis. Alas, her trail goes cold hereÃ¢â‚¬â€we&#8217;ll never know if she finally bobbed her hair. </p>

Los Angeles</p>
<p>Fifteen-year-old Lloyd Alley, arrested today in Los Angeles, is said to have made statements &#8220;tantamount to a confession&#8221; of his involvement with the &#8220;Sacred School of the Great White Brotherhood,&#8221; an Oakland-based &#8220;love cult&#8221; with branches in San Francisco, San Jose, Portland, Chicago, and Texas. At the same time the teenager was spilling the beans in L.A., San Francisco police raided the cult&#8217;s Bay Area headquarters, where they found an &#8220;effigy of a woman with a sword piercing her heart, incoherent messages, cards bearing linked names of males and females and other equally weird evidence.&#8221; Cultists are said to have &#8220;encouraged free love in its most exotic forms&#8221; in its attempts to breed a &#8220;superman&#8221; and &#8220;superwoman.&#8221; &#8220;Mystical marriages&#8221; were arranged and &#8220;the sacred phallic laws&#8221; studied. Also in custody in Los Angeles is Russell Alley (Lloyd&#8217;s father, cult name &#8220;Omar&#8221;). Cult founder and high priestess, Mrs. Gertrude Wright (&#8220;Zareda&#8221; to her followers), is being held in Oakland, along with her disciple, Irma Gibbs (&#8220;Ermengarde,&#8221; a domestic in the Wright home). All were charged with contributing to the delinquency of minors:  Lloyd Alley, plus two young women, Thelma Reid, 17, and Caroline Merwin, 18. </p>
<p>Lloyd Alley and Irma Gibbs both made confessions said to &#8220;be reeking with unprintable details,&#8221; though the paper managed to squeeze in a mention of two &#8220;new Messiah&#8221; ceremonials Lloyd performed with Caroline Merwin. Caroline (whose stepmother&#8217;s complaint set the raid in motion) was quite the little minx:  when she appeared in juvenile court later in the week she relished telling the judge that she wore only &#8220;filmy underthings&#8221; during her initiation ceremony, and that her &#8220;vibration robes&#8221; were scanty as well. When she &#8220;admitted intimacies with Lloyd Alley,&#8221; the two of them laughed until the judge admonished them to be quiet. </p>
<p><i>Times</i> columnist Harry Carr thought the juicy case was nothing but &#8220;Bunk&#8221;: </p>
<blockquote><p>The attempt to paint these girlsÃ¢â‚¬â€and their beef-fed sheiksÃ¢â‚¬â€as innocent, wide-eyed victims of a freak religion is enough to make anybody laugh. </p>
<p>Girls of this day and age are wise guys. </p>
<p>And any one of them knows that a so-called religious cult that involves being &#8220;initiated&#8221; in the presence of men with most of clothes off is merely an excuse for a debauch.</p>
<p>There is at least some hope for a girl who is frank enough to laugh.</BLOCKQUOTE></p>
<p>Caroline Merwin was eventually released into her stepmother&#8217;s custody. Lloyd Alley was remanded into the custody of the Juvenile Detention Home and was later made a ward of the court. In May 1927, a jury deliberated for ten minutes before it found Russell Alley guilty of contributing to the delinquency of minors. Gertrude Wright and Irma Gibbs flew the coop before they could be tried; they remain at large.

March 4, 1927
</p>
<p>
Late last summer, 21-year-old Evelyn Frances Taylor and her 22-year-old friend, Mrs. Bernice Clancy, visited the offices of Dr. W.E. Williams at <a href="&lt;iframe width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; marginheight=&quot;0&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=1548+West+Sixth+Street,+los+angeles,+ca&amp;amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;amp;sspn=62.186014,100.195313&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=34.067165,-118.264389&amp;amp;spn=0.008089,0.012231&amp;amp;z=14&amp;amp;iwloc=addr&amp;amp;output=embed&amp;amp;s=AARTsJoOQbNldBhQYjZ0T-qyRzr0TEEYoA&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=1548 West Sixth Street, los angeles, ca&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=62.186014,100.195313&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.067165,-118.264389&amp;spn=0.008089,0.012231&amp;z=14&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;source=embed" style="color:#0000FF;text-align:left">View Larger Map</a></small>&#8221; target=&#8221;_blank&#8221; title=&#8221;Dr. Williams&#8217;s office&#8221;>1548 West Sixth Street</a>. Evelyn, it seems, was a girl in troubleÃ¢â‚¬â€she was looking for what the <em>Times</em> referred to as an &quot;asserted illegal operation.&quot; Williams provided one, but there were complications, and Evelyn Taylor eventually died from the botched abortion (exactly when was open to questionÃ¢â‚¬â€the <em>Times</em> gave three different dates during their ongoing coverage of the matter). When the State brought murder charges against Dr. Williams in October, Bernice Clancy became the star witness for the prosecution. After all, she had accompanied Evelyn Taylor on the fatal day, and, she told the grand jury, Williams explained the details of the operation to her.
</p>
<p>Clancy began receiving written and oral threats. Then, as she stood on the back porch of her father&#8217;s house one day in January, &quot;a gloved hand closed over her face and mouth and she lost consciousness.&quot; Half an hour later, her father found her in the yard on the other side of the house. &quot;A dish towel had been tied over her face and her feet bound.&quot; Clancy recovered from the attempted kidnapping.
</p>
<p>
Today, as the trial looms closer, Bernice Clancy collapsed in a faint at the home of Inspector Horn, where she has been living under guard. Apparently, &quot;a lineman working on Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ the property made some joking remark to her, which she misinterpreted [<em>or so says the</em> Times]. She was unconscious for almost half an hour and it was necessary to call a physician to revive her,&quot; the <em>Times</em> reported. As a result, the district attorneys prosecuting the trial have ordered that she be held incommunicado &quot;with instructions to not permit her to out on the street unless accompanied by an armed escort.&quot;
</p>
<p>
<em>Update</em>:  Bernice Clancy testified without incident on March 9, 1927. On March 24, after twelve hours of deliberation, the jury found Dr. Williams guilty of manslaughter. His motion for a new trial was granted, but before it began, the original charge against him was thrown out on a technicality. The State of California wasn&#8217;t done with Dr. Williams just yet, however; in June, he was listed as one of six physicians who were to appear before the State Board of Medical Examiners on charges of behavior &quot;inimicable to their profession.&quot;

<div>Omaha, Nebraska<br />
February 26, 1927<br />
(Exclusive)</p>
<p>David Bourdette Burgert passed away in Toledo, Ohio last year. Described by friends as a &#8220;genial gentleman&#8221; and an &#8220;exceptional conversationalist,&#8221; Burgert was also wealthy. Stinking rich, in fact; his estate was valued at $500,000 (almost $6 million in current money). A bachelor, Burgert dictated that all but $500 of his estate be put in a trust fund, the income from which would accrue to the benefit of the Kirkendall family of Omaha, Nebraska. </p>
<p>This was all well and good, especially for the Kirkendalls, but Burgert was a man with a vision. His will stipulated that fifty years after the death of Bourdette Kirkendall, Jr. (two years of age in 1927), the remainder of the trust would be used to build &#8220;a home for girls between the ages of 16 and 28 years, of small stature (no fat girls need apply), bright, ambitious, stylish, and good to look at,&#8221; the Times explained. The newspaper speculated that it might be as long as 100 years before &#8220;The Burgert Apartments&#8221; (the will provided the building&#8217;s name) took shape. Whatever decade the ground was finally broken, no expense was to be spared; at least $50,000 was to be spent on the building&#8217;s construction in Toledo. </p>
<p>The home would provide accommodation for between 30 and 40 girls, slim and &#8220;ambitious to live and to see brighter and better environments of life than what they are used to,&#8221; the will stipulated, &#8220;for young women who have to provide a living for themselves in the business world; who have natural ambitions to see things as their more fortunate sisters see them. </p>
<p>&#8220;Nature has given this type of young woman [the will continued] a love for beautiful things that unfortunately parents can not provide.&#8221; Perhaps with this last codicil in mind, Burgert attached a photograph of himself to the document and requested that it be reproduced as a painting to be hung where &#8220;I may look down on the good work that this will is intended to do&#8221; (and perhaps a pillow fight or two). </p>
<p>&#8220;May the world be bright and happy for those girls as it has been for me,&#8221; the will concluded. One can only hope the &#8220;comely and ambitious&#8221; young women of sometime around 2027 appreciate their benefactor from the past, who clearly didn&#8217;t anticipate the advent of fat discrimination lawsuits.

Glendale<br />
February 19, 1927</p>
<p>On the morning of September 9, 1908, 26-year-old career criminal Carl D. Sutherland shot and killed Los Angeles police Captain W.H. Auble in the course of a robbery gone bad. Two thousand people participated in the manhunt that followed. That night, Sutherland was tracked to the brush near the city limits. Surrounded by police, he threw down his revolver, then drank the contents of a vial of cyanide that hung from his neck. Officers had just enough time to place cuffs on his wrists before Sutherland fell to the ground, dead. The next day&#8217;s headline read:  &#8220;Killer of Brave Officer Takes His Own Worthless Life.&#8221; </p>
<p>Today, nineteen years after Sutherland shot Captain Auble and committed suicide, a Glendale man searching under his house for his dog found a box half buried in the dirt. In it was a 50-page handwritten document in which the cop killer confessed to dozens of other crimes, including burglaries, train and stage coach robberies, as well as a plan to kidnap a California pioneer businessman who once criticized Sutherland when he worked as a waiter. An attached note was addressed to Jack Hendrickson, who, in 1908, was an L.A.P.D. officer Sutherland considered honest. </p>
<p>The son of the first City Marshal of Pittsburgh, Kansas, Sutherland was no Confessing Sam; he was a hardened criminal who for unknown but probably psychological reasons had a need to confess his misdeeds without actually taking responsibility for themÃ¢â‚¬â€-hence the vial of cyanide. He hoped the confession would be published and some of the proceeds given to his wife. Nobody knew how or why the document turned up under the house at 209 North Columbus Avenue in Glendale. </p>
<p>Another mystery, not mentioned by the <i>Times</i> in 1927, is that when Sutherland&#8217;s body was searched shortly after his death, police found a number of stamped and addressed letters. Among them was &#8220;a remarkable history of Sutherland&#8217;s life as set forth by himself. It covered fifty pages of manuscript,&#8221; reported the <i>Times</i> in 1908. The <i>Times</i> published copious portions of that document, which was also addressed to Jack Hendrickson and referenced the planned kidnapping. Was the document found in 1927 a copy of the 1908 letter, hidden by Sutherland or one of his cronies lest the letter go astray? Was it a separate document? How did Sutherland have the time to pen two fifty-page documents after killing Captain Auble in the morning and his own death that evening? Why didn&#8217;t the police in 1927 realize how similar the newly discovered confession was to the letter they presumably read in 1908? </p>
<p>As of February 1927, the police were busy checking their list of unsolved crimes against Sutherland&#8217;s confession.

February 12, 1927</p>
<p>The sad story of Blanche and Grace Stauber was revealed today when the sisters, ages 44 and 51, respectively, landed in the poky after a trip to Judge Baird&#8217;s court. It seems the college-educated spinsters fell on financially hard times after they moved to California in 1910 from their native Kansas. After their pleas to friends and family for monetary assistance went unheeded, Grace started forging checks. She did her best to keep knowledge of her wrongdoing from younger sisterÃ¢â‚¬â€they were daughters of a Methodist minister after all. But when Blanche inevitably discovered her sister&#8217;s malfeasance, she made a pragmatic decision:  they would &#8220;join forces in an effort to keep themselves above poverty&#8221; and, above all, avoid being separated from one another. </p>
<p>It worked like this. Blanche and Grace would move into a small town somewhere in southern California. They&#8217;d rent a house, and Blanche would write a check in the amount of $300 to $600 (roughly $3,600 to $7,200 in today&#8217;s currency), drawn on a bank in another city. Grace would take the check to a bank in their new town, where she would open both savings and checking accounts, depositing half the check in each. Thus funded, the sisters went on a shopping spree, buying merchandise and often receiving change on their purchases. They&#8217;d be gone before the bank opened the following day. </p>
<p>Over the years, Blanche and Grace Stauber passed worthless checks to the total tune of about $25,000 (almost $300,000 today) in twenty-five different towns. The sisters &#8220;prayed frequently&#8221; for the success of their nefarious operations, prayers that appear to have been granted as they eventually opened a store in Palms to dispose of their hot items. </p>
<p>Judge Baird remanded the &#8220;elderly&#8221; sisters to General Hospital, where it was determined they were sane, though lacking in &#8220;moral appreciation.&#8221; Blanche and Grace faced possible sentences of from two to twenty-eight years in San Quentin, but it was said their greatest fear remained being separated.</p>
<p><i>Update:</i> Blanche and Grace Stauber were each sentenced to serve one year in County Jail for forgery and issuing checks without sufficient funds. They were also sentenced to five years&#8217; probation on a separate forgery charge. The sisters didn&#8217;t go quietly:  they &#8220;told probation officers they felt the church owed them a living&#8221; and only started passing paper when it didn&#8217;t come through.</div>

Venice</p>
<p>The twisted tale of Avalona Carnevale began last December 8, when the 30-year-old housewife from Venice made a phone call to her jeweler husband, Vincent. She couldn&#8217;t meet him in Los Angeles after all; he should take the street car home. And with that, she disappearedÃ¢â‚¬â€-dressed in what was described as an expensive fur coat and wearing $1800 worth of jewelry (almost $22,000 today). Vincent waited two weeks, then reported her missing, along with her car.</p>
<p>Police originally suspected foul play. Then, on January 13, the <i>Times</i> ran excerpts from a letter Avalona had written to her parents the previous week. &#8220;Honestly, Mama dear,&#8221; it read in part, &#8220;I have wanted so badly to let you know I am all right. As you know, I have been perfectly miserable the last few years and I was never contented. The climax came and I simply ran away from everything and everybody.&#8221; She was happy now, living in Long Beach with &#8220;a real he-man&#8221; named Bob. Bob, in turn, enclosed a note telling Avalona&#8217;s parents that she was &#8220;in safe and devoted hands.&#8221; </p>
<p>Happy, safe, devotedÃ¢â‚¬â€-it sounded perfectly peachy. Until today, that is, when Avalona made a statement to the police testifying that she had been lured from home by &#8220;a Barnes City circus employee&#8221; who kept her in such a state of constant intoxication that &#8220;she was by turns both unable and fearful to leave him.&#8221; It started with a few drinks in the circus man&#8217;s room. From there they went to a hotel in Culver City, where more alcohol was consumed. Her &#8220;mind was somewhat clouded from that moment on,&#8221; she told police, but her drinking buddy eventually pawned one of her bracelets for $25, which he then spent on liquor. They went to San Francisco and later to Oakland. Avalona didn&#8217;t contact police in those cities because the man beat her frequently, and she was afraid he would kill her if she tried to leave him. Eventually she did, seeking refuge in the home of Mr. and Mrs. A.M. Chisholm. Mr. Chisholm sent a telegram to Vincent Carnevale a week ago, informing him of his wife&#8217;s whereabouts. </p>
<p>That letter to her parents, the one telling them how happy she was with her &#8220;he-man&#8221; in Long Beach? Avalona told police she &#8220;faintly remembered&#8221; writing it. </p>
<p>Her husband retrieved her from Oakland (both the car and the jewels were gone) a few days ago. &#8220;She is my wife; she is in my homeÃ¢â‚¬â€-that, I think is all the evidence you need of my intentions,&#8221; Vincent Carnevale told newsmen. </p>
<p>It was a noble sentiment, but it turned out that Carnevale had signed and sworn to a divorce complaint on January 31Ã¢â‚¬â€-the day after he received notice that his wife was in Oakland. But just as Avalona couldn&#8217;t quite remember writing that damning letter to her parents, Vincent was sketchy about the divorce papers, which were filed with the court on February 7Ã¢â‚¬â€-in error, according to Carnevale. &#8220;I did not mean to have the complaint filed,&#8221; he told the <i>Times</i>. &#8220;I&#8217;d forgotten all about it in my worry and joy at finding her [his errant missus] again. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, the matter is now a closed book.&#8221; </p>
<p>And so it remains.

Gardena</p>
<p>The Artful Dodger would have been nothing without his teacher, Fagin, but the Dare-Devil Club of Gardena didn&#8217;t need anybody to train them in the techniques of thieveryÃ¢â‚¬â€they did it themselves. Indeed, the cops called their social club a &#8220;crime school.&#8221; Today, on the cusp of the club&#8217;s first &#8220;graduation,&#8221; police arrested five of its officers, all between the ages of 10 and 14. The charges? Burglary. The enterprising young criminals first broke into the Gardena schoolhouse. They also plagued Gardena resident T. Tsuchiyare, breaking into his house on three separate occasions and stealing his Kodak camera, jewelry, even the money from his children&#8217;s piggybanks. The boys are scheduled to appear before Judge Archibald next week. Further arrests are expected before then. </p></div>

Altadena</p>
<p>Mayhem ruled the backyard at 1795 Beverly Drive in Aladena this morning, when two 70-year-old pals ended a friendship of almost two decades with a gun. It all started when little Jimmie Jamison, 8-year-old grandson of George Ehret, heard noises from the cellar. The youngster investigated, and discovered Nicholas Tuck drunkenly stumbling around a pile of boxes in the basement. Tuck usually occupied a cottage at the rear of the lot, but for reasons unknown (but probably having to do with his alcohol-soaked condition) climbed through a small side window into the cellar at the main house. He then discovered all the doors were lockedÃ¢â‚¬â€and he couldn&#8217;t get back through window. &#8220;Let me out and I won&#8217;t hurt you,&#8221; he told Jimmie, who obligingly opened the cellar door for grandpa&#8217;s drunken buddy. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, George Ehret, armed with a heavy cane, was headed to the backyard to see about all the commotion. When Tuck, climbing out of the cellar, saw Ehret, he pulled a gun (or so Ehret says). As the two men scuffled, &#8220;the gun exploded,&#8221; lodging a bullet in Ehret&#8217;s thigh. Tuck then fired a shot at Ehret, but missed. He ran a few steps, placed the muzzle against his own head and pulled the trigger. He is close to death. </p>
<p>Ehret told police that Tuck was a mean drunk, and had on more than one occasion threatened him with a gun. He is expected to make a full recovery.

<p>January 15, 1927<br />Los Angeles  </p>
<p>The body of a young man, dressed in sailor&#8217;s togs, was found today by four children playing in an open field near <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=eighteenth+street+and+point+view+avenue,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=50.37814,103.710938&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.045246,-118.372514&#038;spn=0.00649,0.01266&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="Von Bulo's body found">Eighteenth Street and Point View Avenue</a>. The youngsters reported their gruesome discovery to the police, who identified the man as Henry Von Bulo.   </p>
<p>Von Bulo was the third member of a love triangle gone tragically wrong. (Do they ever end happily?) Last month, Curran C. Samuels, age 40, shot his wife, then turned the gun on himself. He died. The missus, though pierced by a bullet that entered her ear and exited her mouth, survived. While in the hospital, Mrs. Samuels told detectives that her husband had probably killed her friend, Henry Von Bulo. She even led them on an unsuccessful search of the vicinity in which his body was eventually found. Mrs. Samuels believes that Von Bulo was killed on December 15, as he did not keep an appointment in Long Beach on that day. Three days later, Mr. Samuels shot his wife near <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=Rossmore+Avenue+and+Wilshire+Boulevard,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=34.045246,-118.372514&#038;sspn=0.00649,0.01266&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.063432,-118.327646&#038;spn=0.006488,0.01266&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="Mrs. Samuels shot near here">Rossmore Avenue and Wilshire Boulevard</a> &quot;where she was engaged as a box-lunch saleswoman.&quot;   </p>
<p>Despite the fact that Von Bulo was dressed in sailor&#8217;s clothing and Mrs. Samuels&#8217;s assertion that he was a member of the merchant marine, Von Bulo&#8217;s stepfather declared that the young man had purchased the uniform and shoes last month in Oakland. He also suggested that his stepson might be the victim of a &quot;bootlegger&#8217;s war,&quot; but declined to further elaborate.  </p>
