<p>
March 17, 1927<br />
Bakersfield
</p>
<p>
Frustrated at being rejected for employment as a nurse by Kern Hospital, twenty-one year old Gladys Maryon Lindley came up with a plan Ã¢â‚¬â€œ become a man!
</p>
<p>
Dressed in menÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clothing and answering to the name Ã¢â‚¬Å“BillyÃ¢â‚¬Â, Gladys presented herself at Kern Hospital once again. Instead of seeking employment as a nurse, Ã¢â‚¬Å“BillyÃ¢â‚¬Â applied for the job of a male orderly this time and was hired on the spot.
</p>
<p>
Gladys went undetected until three months later, when the secret of her identity was revealed by one of her former teachers. Recognizing Ã¢â‚¬Å“BillyÃ¢â‚¬Â at the hospital, the teacher ratted her out to hospital administrators. Gladys &#8211; aka Billy &#8211; resigned immediately.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps naively, the LA Times reported that Ã¢â‚¬Å“a real desire to do hospital work was given as the explanation of the masqueradeÃ¢â‚¬Â.

<p>January 14, 1927 <br />Taft </p>
<p>Hut, two, three, four &ndash; an army of field mice is on the march in <a title="Taft, CA" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=taft,+CA&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=35.14247,-119.45743&#038;spn=2.811783,5.037231&#038;z=8&#038;om=1" target="_blank">Taft</a>, and like most armies, this one travels on its stomach. </p>
<p>Despite being low on the food chain, or maybe because of it, field mice are crafty little creatures, and they can rapidly assess a situation before taking action. While cutting a wide swath through Taft, the mouse invaders spied a small sheep that was confined in a pen and unable to escape. Hundreds of rodent soldiers felt their mousedar vibrate. They swarmed the helpless animal and devoured it on the spot. </p>
<p>Not all mice are evil sheep snacking marauders. On November 18, 1928, <a title="Walt Disney" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney" target="_blank">Walt Disney</a> would introduce an adorable animated <a title="Mickey Mouse" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Mouse" target="_blank">anthropomorphic mouse</a> in the cartoon, <a title="Steamboat Willie" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steamboat_Willie" target="_blank">&ldquo;Steamboat Willie&rdquo;.</a> Nobody would ever look at a mouse in quite the same way. </p>

<div>December 6, 1927<br />Los Angeles</p>
<p>Calling all cars! Calling all cars! Be on the lookout for two easily-recognized scofflaws, film stars Reginald Denny and Hedda Hopper. She&#8217;s wanted for speeding at about 34mph around Melrose and La Brea, he for setting a similar pace in the 20mph zone at Sunset and Vine, and without a valid operator&#8217;s license, on November 28. </p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not all! Denny is also wanted for questioning in the origins of the massive forest fire which began near his cabin near Running Springs Park in the San Bernardino Mountains two nights ago, and which hundreds of men are fighting, with 50 to 75 summer cabins already destroyed.</p>
<p>What shall we do with these antisocial celebrities? Perhaps we should just drop by their homes and have a talk with them. Miss Hopper is reported as residing at 1416 Fairfax Avenue, Mr. Denny at 2060 North Vine.</p>

<p>May 28, 1927 <br />Riverside </p>
<p><em>&quot;I guess the only way to stop divorce is to stop marriage.&quot;</em> &#8212; <a title="Will Rogers" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Rogers" target="_blank">Will Rogers</a> </p>
<p>Everyone is familiar with the <a title="Boy Scouts of America" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Scouts_of_America" target="_blank">Boy Scout</a> motto, Be Prepared, but newlyweds Grant Dewlaney and Ethel Hornaday have prepared themselves for marriage in a way that no Boy Scout ever could have imagined. <img loading="lazy" title="divorce filings" height="120" alt="divorce filings" src="//farm1.static.flickr.com/250/517171207_5cf2f0d733_m.jpg" width="240" align="right" border="0" /></p>
<p>Grant and Ethel hope to spend the rest of their lives together in blissful tandem harness, but what if the unthinkable happens and they fall out of love like the ten couples who filed for divorce today in Los Angeles? </p>
<p>In the event that their love does not endure, the pragmatic pair has taken an unusual step to avoid future battles over the house, furniture, and the family <a title="Ford Model-T" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_T" target="_blank">Ford</a>. Prior to their marriage ceremony they filed an agreement with the Los Angeles County Recorder which may inspire other modern couples to do the same. </p>
<p>The <a title="Pre-Nup" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-nuptial_agreement" target="_blank">contract</a> states that if Ethel ever files for divorce she will accept a settlement of $500 ($5939.25USD 2007) to pay for an attorney, her separate maintenance and any other of her expenses. If Ethel files for divorce before their first wedding anniversary, she has agreed to accept the sum of $300 ($3563.55USD 2007). </p>
<p>Will this type of agreement ever catch on? Only time will tell. </p>

<p>May 3, 1927<br />Pomona&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some call it extortion; we call it a rather clever short con. C.L. Jackson and R.W. Hedgreth, both 48 and old enough to know better, approached service station operators Harold K. Hemmingway and Norman Bliss in the guise of being Prohibition officers, and asked where &#8217;round here one could wet one&#8217;s whistle. After being informed of the details, Jackson and Hedgreth threatened to alert the <em>real</em> Prohibition men of the illegal info being spread, and demanded a pair of tires, gasoline and $25 cash to keep quiet. But Hemmingway noted the serial numbers on the bills and called the law, and the crooks were soon nabbed.</p>
<p>Justice U.E. White must not have thought much of the victims in the case, for he sentenced the men to six months in County Jail, which he promptly suspended for good behavior.&nbsp;  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Reno, Nevada&#8217;s first short residency divorce was granted to Sophia M. Ross of New York, who braved the desert winds and cultural drought for three months so she could be freed of her Albert, who ate mashed potatoes with his hands. &nbsp;</p>

<p>April 6, 1927<br />Redlands&nbsp;</p>
<p>CONfidential to all garage managers: be on the lookout for a swell-looking swell of about 40 sporting diamonds on his fingers, checkered suit and a loud necktie, who pulls up in a swishy wagon spilling tales of his string of racehorses in TJ, the barn he&#8217;s rented for them in town and how he&#8217;ll be bringing the ponies up presently, and in the meanwhile, his car isn&#8217;t running great, so can he hire a car and chauffeur to drive him back to LA, and meanwhile, can you cash this $135 check? </p>
<p>When this charmer stopped by Charles Maynard&#8217;s Pioneer Tranfer Company garage, Maynard was dazzled by his line and said yes, yes, a thousand times yes. Now he&#8217;s got a stolen car on his lot, a bad check in his register and a cranky chauffeur who, after waiting four hours for his client outside a Los Angeles hotel, drove back to Redlands to tell Maynard just what a dope he&#8217;d been. All that glitters, etc.</p>
