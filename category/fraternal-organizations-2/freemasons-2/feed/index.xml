<p>October 16, 1927<br />
Los Angeles</p>
<p>His body was propped against a tree with a shotgun&#8217;s muzzle placed against what remained of his head. He had pulled the trigger with his toe. The note was terse: &#8220;Suicide. No dependents. No estate. No heirs. Please notice in New York World on Oct. 30th to print. $2 inclosed [<em>sic</em>]. Body to science, in reserve, or cremate.&#8221; It was signed &#8220;Anton K. Windsor.&#8221;</p>
<p>But who was the man found by police in <a title="Elysian Park" href="http://www.historicechopark.org/id31.html" target="_blank">Elysian Park</a> shortly after daybreak this morning? Despite the carefully printed signature on the note, police doubted his name was Anton Windsor. If it was, why had he cut all the laundry marks and labels out of his clothing? A shears and razor blade used to do the job were still in his pocket. Identification had also been removed from a <a title="Masonic Apron" href="http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/aqc/apron.html" target="_blank">Masonic apron</a> neatly folded in an inside pocket.</p>
<p>He was rich, according to detectives who cited his expensive gray business suit and outing cap, his soft hands with their careful manicure, and his faceâ€”&#8221;that of a man accustomed to easy living.&#8221; They speculated that his request to have his death noticed in the <a title="New York World" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_World" target="_blank">New York World</a> two weeks from now was a message to someone &#8220;arriving from Europe shortly before that date&#8221; or perhaps he wanted to announce his death &#8220;in connection with some public event, possibly the settling of an estate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another clue to his identity (the <em>Times</em> referred to it as the &#8220;only clew&#8221;; they apparently didn&#8217;t count his Masonic affiliation) was the &#8220;ancient&#8221; <a title="J. Manton &amp; Co." href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Manton" target="_blank">J. Manton &amp; Co.</a> shotgun he used.</p>
<p>Who were you, Anton K. Windsor?</p>

<span style="font-size: 100%;">Jan. 12, 1907<br />
</span><span style="font-size: 100%;">El Monte<br />
</span><span style="font-size: 100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size: 100%;">For half a century, the Baptist Church of El Monte and the MasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Lexington Lodge No. 104 shared a clapboard building on Main Street, the worshipers on the first floor and the Masons, as always, on the second.<br />
</span><span style="font-size: 100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size: 100%;">Then came the developers and the urge to grow.<br />
</span><span style="font-size: 100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size: 100%;">Ã¢â‚¬Å“Seized with the thrill of the new trolley boom, the lodge members are about to put up a new Masonic temple; the Baptists, who have shared quarters with the Masons of El Monte for more than 50 years, are also said to be ambitious for a new place,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times says.<br />
</span><span style="font-size: 100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size: 100%;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">Taking the original name of the settlement, the Masons founded Lexington Lodge in May 1853, making it one of the oldest in California, and sent for regalia that came around the Horn from the East. One of the early lodge members, Elkenna Parrish, can still be seen driving his buggy around El Monte, The Times says.</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lmharnisch.com/images/1907_0112B.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="//www.lmharnisch.com/images/1907_0112B.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />
<span style="font-size: 100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size: 100%;">The Baptists, meanwhile, built the first Baptist church south of the Tehachapi, using ox teams to haul lumber from San Bernardino. The Rev. J.C. Freyer arrived after a six-month journey from Alabama and was the first Baptist minister ordained in Southern California, The Times says.<br />
</span><span style="font-size: 100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size: 100%;">The Baptists had outgrown the structure, built in 1866, and wanted a new church, but the Masons refused to yield their half, so they purchased the building in 1906 in an attempt to save it. By the next year, however, they agreed to let the small, old building come down.<br />
