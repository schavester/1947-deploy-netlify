<div>February 1, 1927<br />Whittier</p>
<p>Family annihilator <a href="https://laurajames.typepad.com/clews/2005/08/if_ever_a_man_d.html" target="_blank">George Hassell</a> was convicted of killing his wife and her eight children by his late brother, and has an appointment with the Texas executioner shortly. While awaiting his last date, George recalled the wife he killed in Whittier in 1917 and the three children he buried with her beneath their little home at 236 South Whittier Avenue. There seemed no reason not to confess this, so today, with some direction from long-suspicious neighbor Myrtle Lark and a little more from the agreeable killer, Constable Bob Way crawled under the house and unearthed the body of an infant. Its mother and siblings soon followed, thus explaining the wretched odors that had long plagued the spot.</p>
<p>In slightly gayer news, the grand new Mayfair Hotel has opened in the Crown Hill district of Los Angeles, providing the ideal vantage point for a drunken oil company exec named Ray Chandler to hole up for days with his secretary while threatening suicide to all who&#8217;ll listen.</p>

<p>December 27, 1927<br />Los Angeles</p>
<p>Carlos Monroy, 35, was that precarious combination, a glazier and lush, and the missus no longer wished to live with him. So Anita, 29, took Carlos Junior, 10, and moved in with mama, Antonia Barron of 626 East 36th Place, while Carlos stayed with his mother and brother at 2915 New Jersey Street. </p>
<p>It being Christmas, Carlos found himself missing his family, and dropped by the Barron home, with a bottle of whiskey and a long line of apologies. Anita didn&#8217;t want to hear it. She intended to be divorced, and further, she and her sister Leonora were going downtown to shop. Would he please leave?</p>
<p>Anita went to the bathroom, and Carlos followed her in, where he drew a razor from his coat pocket and slashed at her throat. Anita ran, bleeding and screaming, through the spare bedroom and into the dining room. Carlos finished her off there, then turned the blade on himself. Their son and the Barron women were witnesses to the carnage, then called for aid, though it was far too late for anything but tears.</p>

<p>December 24, 1927<br />Los Angeles </p>
<p>Dominating newspaper headlines for the past several days has been the slaying of twelve year old school girl, Marion Parker. Her killer, William Edward Hickman, is currently in Oregon awaiting extradition. He&rsquo;ll return by train under heavy guard to Los Angeles, where he faces the death penalty for the horrific crime. </p>
<p>Long before newspapers were delivered to the doorsteps of most American homes, information was spread by song &ndash; and it&rsquo;s a practice that continues to this day. Ballads have been written about floods, mining disasters, shipwrecks, and murder. Marion Parker&rsquo;s tragic story inspired prolific song writer <a title="Rev Andrew Jenkins" href="https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-887" target="_blank">Reverend Andrew Jenkins</a> of Atlanta, Georgia to pen the poignant &ldquo;Ballad of Marian [sic] Parker&rdquo;. </p>
<p>The Ballad of Marian Parker</p>
<p>&#8216;Way out in California,<br />A family bright and gay<br />Were preparing for their Christmas<br />Not very far away.</p>
<p>They had a little daughter,<br />A sweet and pretty child.<br />And everyone who knew her<br />Loved Marian Parker&#8217;s smile.</p>
<p>She left her home one morning<br />For her school not far away.<br />And no one dreamed that danger,<br />Was lurking near that day.</p>
<p>But then a murdrous villain,<br />A fiend with heart of stone,<br />Took little Marian Parker<br />Away from friends and home.</p>
<p>The world was horror-stricken,<br />The people held their breath,<br />Until they found poor Marian,<br />Her body cold in death.</p>
<p>They hunted for the coward,<br />Young Hickman was their man.<br />They brought him back to justice,<br />His final trial to stand.</p>
<p>The jury found him guilty,<br />Of course they could not fail.<br />He must be executed<br />Soon in San Quentin jail.</p>
<p>And while he waits his sentence,<br />Let&#8217;s hope he learns to pray<br />To make his black soul ready<br />For the great judgement day.</p>
<p>There is a great commandment<br />That says, &quot;Thou shalt not kill&quot;<br />And those who do not head it,<br />Their cup of sorrow fill </p>

<p>Following up yesterday&rsquo;s story about whether one Ray McCoy was lynched for looking too much like Edward Hickman&hellip;</p>
<p>The verdict of the Coroner&rsquo;s jury?&nbsp; Jail officials and other prisoners, all vindicated.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it seems that Ralph &ldquo;Ray McCoy&rdquo; Fuller raised the ire of Angelenos in the grip of Hickman fever, whose Hickmanmania (Hickmania?&nbsp; Hickmentia?) led an angry mob to chase down and beat Fuller something fierce, believing the twenty year-old to be Hickman, after Fuller robbed a store at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=242+S+Main+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90012&#038;sll=34.050606,-118.245104&#038;sspn=0.002018,0.0036&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.051397,-118.245099&#038;spn=0.008071,0.014398&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="meyers">242 South Main</a> and was chased two blocks on foot.</p>
<p>Fellow prisoner Fred Meadows told the Times that once in the hoosegow, the sullen and reserved Fuller was regarded as just another popped burglar.&nbsp; Meadows related how he and the boys started playing &ldquo;Sundown&rdquo; in an outer tank and when he returned, Fuller had hanged himself with Meadows&rsquo; scarf.&nbsp; (Must be nice to have scarves.&nbsp; And <a href="https://www.latimes.com/news/local/los_angeles_metro/la-me-jail27nov27,1,3016141.story?track=rss" target="_blank" title="andfreedom">pianos</a>.)</p>
<p>In other lynching news, any and all information regarding Hickman&rsquo;s departure and route from Pendleton (where he was exhibited in a cage like a circus animal) to Los Angeles County Jail is being kept under strict secrecy. &nbsp;</p>

<p>December 20, 1927<br />Los Angeles</p>
<p>As police scour the Bellevue Arms apartment*of &quot;Donald Evans&quot; (an alias for Marion Parker&#8217;s purported slayer Edward Hickman, otherwise known as The Fox), they find portions of a chocolate cake, broken golf clubs, and dirty dishes suggesting a hurried departure. Marion&#8217;s father Perry, upon discovering that the suspect is a former employee at his Seventh and Spring Street bank who he dismissed on fraud charges, says that the voice on the telephone demanding the $1500 ransom was similar to Hickman&#8217;s peculiarly blas&eacute; speech patterns when discussing his offense, but that at no time did he believe the young man meant harm to him or his family. </p>
<p>Little Marion&#8217;s outraged body lies in the morgue, a tiny, heartbreaking bundle with her missing limbs, hollowed core and unseeing eyes sewn open in doll-like pretence of life. In one small mercy, the Parker&#8217;s neighbor is the Autopsy Surgeon, and it&#8217;s this Dr. Wagner who makes the identification and pieces his little friend together from the parts that are brought in, wrapped in newspaper, from where they were scattered in Elysian Park. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The reward for The Fox&#8217; capture has swelled to $62,400, with new pledges from outraged citizens, radio stations and fraternal organizations arriving hourly. Will The Fox be snared, or will he slip away to menace other cities, other daughters? Tune in tomorrow to find out!</p>
<p>*attention, modern readers: the Bellevue Arms is the partly boarded up, expansive brick apartment building flush against the 101 freeway heading north out of downtown. The Fox&#8217; lair was upstairs in the middle rear of the Western, burned-out wing. If you decide to visit, you&#8217;ll come via Sunset Boulevard, and via&#8230; <strong>MARION</strong>.</p>

<p>November 20, 1927<br />Los Angeles  </p>
<p>There are criminal masterminds, and then there are men like William E. McLane. Around 2 o&#8217;clock this afternoon, McLane walked in the back door of his home at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=901+Palm+View+Drive,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=58.033539,93.691406&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.125003,-118.179824&#038;spn=0.007514,0.011437&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">901 Palm View Drive</a>. &quot;I came back to the house today to see how she was getting along,&quot; he told the police swarming his house. &quot;She&quot; was his wife, Ada May, and she wasn&#8217;t getting along very well at all&mdash;in fact, she was dead. While they were less than impressed with his display of husbandly solicitude, detectives were happy to take McLane into custody after he confessed to Ada May&#8217;s murder. Ever the helpful suspect, McLane then explained that, contrary to police speculation, the bloody pair of scissors found next to his wife&#8217;s body was not in fact the murder weapon:  he had used a Barlow knife, which he tossed into the night as he ran from the scene of the crime.   The couple had been separated for about five months, and McLane recently received divorce papers from his wife. This, he told detectives, inspired him to attempt a reconciliation&mdash;an attempt which led not to the revival of their marriage but to a quarrel that resulted in the death of Mrs. McLane. </p>
<p>Ada May apparently held no such illusions of renewed connubial bliss; her body was found by a friend who came to check on her after she told him her husband had threatened her life on several recent occasions.  </p>

<p>August 27, 1927 <br />Pasadena </p>
<p>All it takes to be considered insane these days is to assert your First Amendment right to free speech&hellip;with a knife. <img loading="lazy" title="Oppressed Cartoon" height="500" alt="Oppressed Cartoon" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1389/1242945453_a79eec6e04.jpg" width="439" align="right" border="0" /></p>
<p>According to night watchman F.M. Winchester, he was making his rounds when a man confronted him shouting, &ldquo;Down with America! Sacco is dead!&rdquo; The agitated man then lunged at him with a shiv. </p>
<p>The aptly named Winchester fired three shots above the man&rsquo;s head, at which time the stranger turned and ran off into the night. The shots drew a crowd of on-lookers and police to Miller&rsquo;s Alley near Marengo Avenue. </p>
<p>Detective Sergeants Cheek, Mansell, and Officer Armer followed the trail of the alleged lunatic, who was subsequently identified as Elias Soto Hernandez. The suspect was arrested at 230 East Union Street and transported to the County Hospital in Los Angeles on suspicion that he may be insane. </p>
<p>Hernandez was protesting the execution in Massachusetts of Italian born anarchists and convicted murderers, <a title="Sacco and Vanzetti" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacco_and_vanzetti" target="_blank">Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti</a>. Their executions on August 23rd followed two trials of dubious fairness. Both trials were presided over by Judge Webster Thayer who displayed a blatant bias against the defendants. During the second trial, defense motions made by California attorney Fred Moore were frequently denied by the Judge who said, &quot;No long-haired anarchist from California can run this court!&quot; Thayer was also overheard referring to Sacco and Vanzetti as, &ldquo;&hellip;those anarchistic bastards&hellip;&rdquo;. </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="Sacco and Vanzetti" height="328" alt="Sacco and Vanzetti" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1248/1242945901_07a891e20c.jpg" width="500" align="left" border="0" />Whether or not the men were guilty of robbery and murder remains a topic for debate. What is certain is that their case was the culmination of the first so-called &ldquo;Red Scare&rdquo; which began amid the violence, chaos, and political unrest circling the globe during World War I. </p>
<p>World wide protests had failed to save the condemned men from the electric chair, but fifty years later on August 23, 1977, Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis (who became the democratic presidential nominee in 1988) issued the proclamation that the men had been treated unjustly and that &quot;any disgrace should be forever removed from their names.&quot; </p>
