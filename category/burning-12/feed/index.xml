<p>Calling all cars! Calling all cars! Be on the lookout for two easily-recognized scofflaws, film stars Reginald Denny and Hedda Hopper. She&#8217;s wanted for speeding at about 34mph around Melrose and La Brea, he for setting a similar pace in the 20mph zone at Sunset and Vine, and without a valid operator&#8217;s license, on November 28. </p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not all! Denny is also wanted for questioning in the origins of the massive forest fire which began near his cabin near Running Springs Park in the San Bernardino Mountains two nights ago, and which hundreds of men are fighting, with 50 to 75 summer cabins already destroyed.</p>
<p>What shall we do with these antisocial celebrities? Perhaps we should just drop by their homes and have a talk with them. Miss Hopper is reported as residing at 1416 Fairfax Avenue, Mr. Denny at 2060 North Vine.</p>

<p>November 15, 1927<br />Los Angeles</p>
<p>All around town, the news is notable.</p>
<p>Off in Owensmouth (Canoga Park to you crazy modernists), the citizens complain there are so many stray dogs in the streets, it&#8217;s worse than Constantinople. Consider the deep valley as your next exotic vacation spot.</p>
<p>Mrs. Andria Reyes, 34, has eleven children and a husband who won&#8217;t work, and they all have the munchies. That&#8217;s more or less the excuse she gave Judge Westover for her small marijuana farming operation.</p>
<p>1120 East 32nd Street was burning, and Mrs. Frankie Weaver, 64, escaped unharmed. But once on the street, she realized she&#8217;d forgotten her canary Dickey. Back into the flaming second floor she charged, only to fall back, burned, inconsolable, without her little pet. They found her on the neighbors&#8217; porch, badly injured but unaware of herself, gazing mournfully into the fire, and took her to Georgia Street for treatment.</p>
<p>And in Wahperton, North Dakota, comes the passing of Hans Langseth, who had not cut his beard since July 14, 1875. It measured 17 feet when he breathed his last, and he could not only wear it round his neck like a muffler (mmm, sexy!), but traveled the world as a circus exhibition and won the 1922 world&#8217;s longest competition at the Days of &#8217;49 celebration in Sacramento. We hear these things grow posthumously, so let&#8217;s call Hans&#8217; crowning glory 17 feet, 1 inch. Huzzah!</p>

<p>Of course we know that pigtails have gone the way of the dodo for the li&rsquo;l &lsquo;uns, torn asunder by the terrible rake of modernity, but we never thought the <em>bob</em> would be stomped extinct by carnality and venality, modernity&rsquo;s ugly little twins.&nbsp; But the bob is gone!&nbsp; Long live the permanent wave!</p>
<p>Here, five year-old Dottie Landvogt, of the Seventy-Sixty Street Landvogts, sits at Johanna&rsquo;s Permanent Wave Shop in the Pantages Building on Broadway.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s hooked up to one of those <a title="nessler" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Nessler">Charles Nessler</a> contraptions&mdash;a crazy of octopus holding two-pound brass rollers on a system of counterweights, suspended from a chandelier; the curlers, filled with a Borax paste reagent, are electrically heated to 200+ degrees to boil and steam the hair and, because Nessler didn&rsquo;t have a shop in Los Angeles, this was probably one of the many cheap knock-off machines.&nbsp; Which meant Dot likely ended up with a nicely burned scalp to match her &lsquo;do.</p>
<p>But such is the price of beauty.</p>
<p>By the time Dorothy is ten, heatless waves will be all the rage, so we wish her the best of luck in still having hair.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When, oh when, oh when will something be done to soothe the smoldering peat fires that spill noxious smoke and gas from the vicinity of J<a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=Jefferson+and+Hauser,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=34.04458,-118.24896&#038;sspn=0.008161,0.013733&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.026646,-118.365154&#038;spn=0.008163,0.013733&#038;t=k&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">efferson and Hauser Streets</a> in the Baldwin Hills? For more than two years the fire has crept inexorably deeper into the peat beds, and now twelve acres are burning just under the topsoil, endangering the health of 200,000 local lungs and the ankles of any local foolish enough to tramp through the booby-trapped fields. Forget the living! What of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bog_body" target="_blank">mummies</a>?!</p>
<p>Former City Councilman Mallard has issues a plea on behalf of his neighborhood that the City Council take this &quot;rank poison&quot; threat seriously and extinguish the blaze immediately. He even tells them how to do it: through steam shovels that can expose the burning beds, so water can be introduced. Of course, Mallard&#8217;s suggestion that the fire be fought in the manner of William Mulholland&#8217;s aqueduct project&mdash;get it done first, then get the permits&mdash;seems in retrospect to be in somewhat less than good taste, but the St. Francis dam disaster is still six months away, and the Mullholland name an untarnished example of Angeleno ingenuity.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>In New York City, pioneer developer Gaylord Wilshire has died. In recent years, he <a href="https://www.thebakken.org/artifacts/wilshire.htm" target="_blank">devoted</a> himself to promoting an electric &quot;health belt&quot; of his own invention, the &ldquo;I-ON-A-CO.&rdquo;</div>

<p><img loading="lazy" width="205" height="300" border="0" align="left" title="flw" alt="flw" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1269/1246437393_8d714c93d6_o.gif" />August 26, 1927<br />Madison, Wisc.</p>
<p>Frank Lloyd Wright was a favorite son of Los Angeles, where he threw off the Prairie mantle and began creating his kooky indigenous-flavored block houses (e.g., Storer, Millard, Ennis, Freeman) in contrast to the Spanish Colonial (or, say, Egyptoid Tudor Chateauxesque) prevalent in the Southland&rsquo;s early 20s, before he said to hell with LA and lit out for his cursed home, Taliesin. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There was much architectural buzz about Mr. Wright in 1927, as he&rsquo;d already designed a theater model for Aline Barnsdall, who announced in January that she&rsquo;d build the structure as part of her eight-acre &ldquo;city cultural center&rdquo; gift to Los Angeles of her own FLW <a href="https://www.hollyhockhouse.net/" target="_blank" title="hollyhock">Hollyhock House</a> and property. </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="176" border="0" title="barnsdall" alt="barnsdall" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1341/1246550016_e0a60d670f_o.gif" /></p>
<p>When the Smart People of to-day tour FLW&#8217;s block houses and consider his play of light over form, and gauge its relationship between the zig of Meiji woodblock prints and the zag of Walter Burley Griffin&rsquo;s green thumb, they probably aren&rsquo;t informed that ol&rsquo; FLW had a lurid past fit for any tabloid-worthy favorite son of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>For example, while married to Catherine Wright, he fell in love with another woman, one Mamah Borthwick.&nbsp; Catherine wouldn&rsquo;t divorce him, so Wright abandoned her and the six kids and went galavanting around Europe with Mamah.&nbsp; On his return, Catherine still wouldn&rsquo;t divorce him, so Wright brought scandal to Spring Green, Wisc. by shacking up with Mamah.&nbsp; This was sorted out in short order when one of his domestics decided to utilize a Wrightian architectural principal&mdash;one door for all purposes&mdash;which made it easy to axe-murder seven people trying to flee a Taliesin you&rsquo;d just set on fire.&nbsp; And Mamah was one of those so axed.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Catherine finally divorced Frank in 1922 on charges of desertion, so he could marry his new love, a morphine addict named Miriam Noel.&nbsp; They married in 1923, separated in 1924; Wright began seeing Petrograd Ballet dancer Olgivanna Lazovich Milanov (thirty-three years his junior) in 1925 and was thereafter arrested in 1926 for violating the Mann (White-Slave Traffic) Act.&nbsp; Oh, and Taliesin burned <em>again</em>, though this time without anybody being hacked to bits.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="376" height="251" border="0" title="frankgettingpopped" alt="frankgettingpopped" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1031/1246437375_97ccaf7d7a_o.gif" /><br />Frank getting popped by the feds, 1926&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="209" height="233" border="0" align="right" title="divorce" alt="divorce" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1404/1246550024_073ed04972_o.gif" />The lucky Wright-drama followers of 1927 were treated to tales of Frank and Miriam&rsquo;s divorce.&nbsp; Today, Miriam was awarded $6,000 ($66,179 USD2006) immediately, $30,000 (330,889) in trust, and $250 (2,757) a month for life.&nbsp; The cash settlement and Wright&rsquo;s promise that he &quot;would lead a moral life&quot; preceded the court decree.</p>
<p>With a cushy settlement like that, you&rsquo;d think that&rsquo;s the last we hear of Miss Miriam.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d be wrong.&nbsp; She spends the next few years loudly proclaiming Wright&rsquo;s brutality and repellant morals, with much effort expended in Washington attempting to get Olga deported.&nbsp; In a typical Miriam moment, July 14, 1928, she is arrested on a charge of malicious mischief after breaking <img loading="lazy" width="141" height="300" border="0" align="left" title="miriam" alt="miriam" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1043/1247462700_09c3d5a10e_o.gif" />into FLW&rsquo;s rented La Jolla home while he&rsquo;s up in Los Angeles:&nbsp; &ldquo;So thorough was the wrecking that the colored maid in charge of the house in Wright&rsquo;s absence collapsed from the shock and was taken to the Scripps Memorial Hospital.&nbsp; &lsquo;About fifteen minutes more and I would have leveled the place,&rsquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Wright is said to have told police when arrested&hellip;damage to the La Jolla home is estimated at about $1000&hellip;Mrs. Wright smiling pleaded guilty and following the court action, swore out complaints against her husband and Olga Hinzenberg, also known as Olga Milanoff, charging them with being lewd and dissolute persons.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Miriam finally expires in 1930.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll keep you posted on all breaking FLW news.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d keep an eye on that Schindler character if I were you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>August 10, 1927<br />Los Angeles&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Hauser and Jefferson today, Vernadine Burke and Margaret Goesman, both 16, sank up to their ankles in the burning peat that was combusting merrily away beneath the surface. In trying to extricate themselves, the horrified girls also scorched their hands. They were treated at Receiving Hospital and released.</p>
<p>At the Biltmore, manager and VP James Woods was deftly fending off the insistent demands of Captain J.M. Burman, mariner, aviator and San Pedro resident, that the hotel back his scheme to fly from Japan to Los Angeles with his pet baboon as his co-pilot. Burman states he is ideally suited for such a flight because he knows all the Pacific mountain peaks by which he and his monkey pal would steer.</p>
<p>And in Venice, Mrs. Anna E. Van Skike was planning to celebrate her 67th birthday with a 25-mile swim from Point Dume back to her home shore, in recognition of the good health that regular swimming has brought her. Her doctors declared she had tuberculosis at 55 and would surely die, but swimming chased the lung blots away for the Oklahoma native. Hundreds turned out in 1924 to watch the lady dive off the Venice pier, swim ten miles along the shore and sing the &quot;Star Spangled Banner&quot; from the waves on her return.</p>
<p> This is Van Skike&#8217;s seventh birthday distance swim, and her longest, and will be done with the support, encouragement and liberal doses of hot coffee from lifeguards Slert and Kinney, who will row their boat in the wake of the olive oil-coated &quot;aged mermaid.&quot; She&#8217;ll begin the feat at 2am and hopes to be home in time for dinner, though she often quips she would &quot;rather swim than eat&quot; and avoids fried food and pastry for their waterlogging effects. She prefers the pre-dawn hours for her feats, as the water is calmer then, and she is subject to seasickness in heavy surf. She has founded a distance swimming club, and recommends the activity to all.</p>

<div align="left">In this, our nation&#8217;s 152nd year of independence, residents of Los Angeles found time for picnics, sun-bathing, fireworks, and even a little rioting.</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">Over a ton of barbecued beef was served in Echo Park at the National Association of Letter Carriers 4th of July picnic, where about 5000 federal employees and their families gathered to feast, dance to music by the Letter Carriers&#8217; Band, play baseball, and of course, listen to a rousing speech by Postmaster O&#8217;Brien himself.&nbsp; The Knights of Columbus went to <a title="lunapark" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=3800+mission+rd.,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=34.031287,-118.264539&#038;sspn=0.008536,0.020084&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.069938,-118.199608&#038;spn=0.008532,0.020084&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1">Luna Park</a>, while the Irish partied at <a title="rosehill" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=4520+mercury+rd,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=34.069938,-118.199608&#038;sspn=0.008532,0.020084&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.086094,-118.190145&#038;spn=0.068241,0.160675&#038;z=13&#038;om=1">Rose Hill Park</a>.&nbsp; It is estimated that about 500,000 Angelenos took in one of the many oceanside fireworks extravaganzas up and down the beach.&nbsp; Passenger records between Los Angeles and the Catalina Islands were shattered also shattered this weekend.</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">In Chinatown, however, the mood was less festive.&nbsp; Tired of being arrested for violating the City&#8217;s fireworks ordinances, a mob of about 100 Chinatown residents surrounded a police officer and firefighter, and threatened them with violence.&nbsp; Their &quot;skyrocketing oriental tempers&quot; were quelled when a police riot squad showed up and arrested the mob&#8217;s two ringleaders.&nbsp; Patrolman Fogarty and Fireman Hoag were found holding the mob at bay from a corner on <a title="losangelesstreet" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=n.+los+angeles+st.,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=34.05332,-118.24498&#038;sspn=0.136535,0.32135&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.054775,-118.239799&#038;spn=0.008533,0.020084&#038;z=16&#038;om=1">North Los Angeles St.</a>, near Ferguson Alley when help arrived; however, neither man was harmed.</p>
</div>
<div align="left">And sadly, the 4th of July holiday was darkened by the children who fell victim to prematurely exploding fireworks.&nbsp; While most injuries were not severe, 6-year-old Mary Hackwell of <a title="maryhackwell" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=1047+w.+88th+st.,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=34.054775,-118.239799&#038;sspn=0.008533,0.020084&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=33.958116,-118.292842&#038;spn=0.008543,0.020084&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1">1047 1/2 W. 88th St.</a> hovered near death at General Hospital after a sparkler ignited her clothes.&nbsp; Her father also sustained serious burns while putting out the flames.&nbsp; Little Mary died on July 8, 1927.</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">On a lighter note, check some zany goings-on at the old Luna Park Zoo <a href="https://jpg2.lapl.org/pics20/00019654.jpg" target="_blank" title="lunaparklion">here</a> and <a href="https://jpg2.lapl.org/pics20/00019636.jpg" target="_blank" title="manhugsbear">here</a>.&nbsp; If you got a notion to hug a bear, have your car washed by an orangutan, or feed your baby to a lion, this was apparently the place to do it.&nbsp;</div>

<p>Was it murder?&nbsp; Some folks thought so.&nbsp; In addition to charges for arson and destroying insured property, Ferlin was charged with the murder of Walter Skala, despite the fact that he wished him no harm and was over a mile away at the time Skala sustained his injuries.&nbsp; The charge was issued under an old and little-used California statute that held a person who conspired to commit an unlawful act responsible if another person was indirectly killed as a result of that crime.</p>
<p>At Ferlin&#8217;s trial, the judge instructed the jury to deliberate only on the two lesser charges and acquit on murder.&nbsp; However, the jury ignored him roundly, saying they felt Ferlin was &quot;morally guilty&quot; in Skala&#8217;s death and convicted him of murder.&nbsp; Of course, there were appeals at the District and State level that dragged on for over two years while Ferlin sat in prison.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there was trouble at home.&nbsp; Ferlin&#8217;s wife, Jean, and her lover, Ivan Hunsacker, appeared in juvenile court on charges of contributing to the delinquency of two minors, Jean&#8217;s children.&nbsp; Apparently, since Ferlin was locked away, Hunsacker had been shacking up with Jean and the kiddies.&nbsp; The couple pled guilty to the charges.</p>
<p>In March 1927, the State Supreme Court announced that Ferlin&#8217;s appeal would be heard, along with three other notorious murder cases.&nbsp; Faithful 1947project readers will be interested to know that Earl J. Clark, aka the <a href="https://pensive-torvalds-020d34.netlify.app/redrosekiller" target="_blank" title="redrosekiller">Red Rose Killer</a>, was alongside Ferlin on the docket.&nbsp; Clark would hang at San Quentin later in the year, but things went better for our arsonist.</p>
<p>Today, the court ruled that Ferlin was entitled to a new trial on the murder charge since the jury had disregarded the instructions of the trial judge.&nbsp; Ferlin&#8217;s sentence of 25 years for his other convictions was upheld.&nbsp; The murder beef was eventually dismissed in 1928.</div>

<p>Now that the ash from the Griffith Park and Catalina firestorms has settled, citizens want to know what local governments plan do to protect our precious parks from more devastating fires. One solution that&#8217;s been proposed is simple, inexpensive and ecological: hire herds of trained fire goats to eat the dry brush before it has a chance to burn. The online <a href="https://www.petitiononline.com/firegoat/petition.html" target="_blank">Fire Goats Petition</a> has been signed by more than 900 people and featured on KABC news, KFI&#8217;s John and Ken Show, KFWB, KTLK, LA CityBeat and LAObserved.</p>
<p>On Wednesday evening, May 23, community members come together at a Griffith Park Community Meeting called by Councilman Tom LaBonge to discuss the future of the park post-fire and to salute the brave LAFD Officers who served on the fire line. Refreshments will be served. The meeting starts at 6pm, but outside the venue at 5:30pm, members of the public and media will have a chance to learn more about the Fire Goats from a very special group of humans and animals.</p>
<p><strong>Frankie the Fire Goat</strong>, animal ambassador for fire safety, will be on hand in his cute little fire hat to pose for photos solo and with his members of his beautiful showgirl fan club, <strong>The Ashettes.</strong> Also attending is Frankie&#8217;s shepherdess, <strong>Sarah Bunten of Nanny and Billy&#8217;s Vegetative Management</strong>, to answer questions about her nine years experience clearing brush with managed herds, including her current work for the Getty Museum. <strong>Kim Cooper</strong>, author of the Fire Goat Petition will be present, as will <strong>Judy Cairns from Peck Park Goats,</strong> a citizens group dedicated to retaining Sarah&#8217;s herd year-round at San Pedro&#8217;s Peck Park, where they would be part of an urban farm youth educational program when not clearing brush at other SoCal sites.</p>
<p>Managed grazing by hired herds might sound like an oddball idea, but it&#8217;s been enthusiastically embraced in Northern California, which has spent the past 16 years since the deadly 1991 Oakland Hills Conflagration largely fire-free, in stark contrast to flame-swept SoCal. Why are goats the best choice to clear deadly dry brush from our hills and canyons? SAVINGS: acre-for-acre, the cost for a goat herd to clear land is about half the cost of human brush clearing, and goats aren&#8217;t just immune to poison oak, they eat it! EFFICIENCY: a herd of 350 goats can clear an acre in a day, leaving the grass cropped down to putting green height and dangerous dry brush eliminated. Plus they can get into areas that humans can&#8217;t safely reach. ENVIRONMENT: unlike gasoline-powered brush clearing tools, goats are quiet and nearly carbon-neutral, and they fertilize the land as they work. CHARISMA: goats are so cute, they&#8217;re a perfect advertisement for fire safety, an issue we all need to be more aware of.</p>
<p>Please come out Wednesday to learn more about this innovative fire fighting technique, discuss the future of Griffith Park and give a big thank you to the fire fighters who did such a wonderful job two weeks ago.</p>
