										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Great Day is upon us.</p>
<p>Few weeks back I penned <a title="47PpLAN" href="/web/20160314090107/https://1947project.com/47PplaysLANoire" target="_blank">a review of <em>LA Noire</em></a> which has since had a few thousand page reads.&nbsp; Our piece generated interest only because I&#8217;d played the game so early.&nbsp; Still, must confess to being enamored of the reaction it received.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>It can be interesting/painful to read</em> was the <a title="painfullyinteresting" href="/web/20160314090107/http://messages.finance.yahoo.com/Stocks_%28A_to_Z%29/Stocks_T/threadview?m=tm&amp;bn=51309&amp;tid=58285&amp;mid=58354&amp;tof=1&amp;rt=2&amp;frt=2&amp;off=1" target="_blank">standout</a>:&nbsp; in that my historical interpretation was <em>interesting</em>, as such must infer <em>painful</em> did not connote my words were mere product of yr average monograph-producing dullard whose role as an academic historian serves no-one but his colleague.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t get me wrong<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">â€”</span>most of my work is performed for a small circle in allied studies<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">â€”</span>but the social function of critiquing <em>LA Noire</em> I take as a solemn task.&nbsp; In any event, I&#8217;m going to consider <em>painful</em> as synonymous with <em>challenging</em>.&nbsp; (&#8220;Blogging&#8221; <em>Noire</em> makes the process all the more important and aggravating&#8230;that I subconsciously include but consciously reject Sherman Kent&#8217;s <em>Writing History; </em>never thought I&#8217;d have to grapple with <em>that</em>.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>My critique of <em>Noire</em> resulted in a little behind-the-scenes action, as you might imagine.&nbsp; Actually, I don&#8217;t know <em>what</em> you might imagine.&nbsp; Probably some dime-novel enantiodromia:&nbsp; &#8220;Rockstar worked so hard on recreating the world of 1947 Los Angeles, they may&#8217;ve well given us a game about dragging an oxcart through the Duchy of Lotharingia.&#8221;&nbsp; Nope, never implied that, nor did R* have to send their dime-novel goons after me either.&nbsp; Rather, now that the reviews are coming in fast and furious, it looks like they have their issues.&nbsp; And I have mine.&nbsp; Overall, me and the conventional reviewer are both quite positive.&nbsp; I, however, represent that previously unthought-of, unrecognized, and underutilized market:&nbsp; the first-time gamer.&nbsp; Who knew?</p>
<p>Anyway&#8230;as I aimlessly occupy myself like everyone else for said game to be released in a coupla hours, we&#8217;ll amuse ourselves by playing &#8220;Critique the Critiques!&#8221;&nbsp; (Which I must admit is rather pointless as everyone who might read this once it&#8217;s posted will be glued to their consoles, chasing bad guys <a title="URM" href="/web/20160314090107/http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/assetserver/controller/view/DW-B5-52A-15-ISLA" target="_blank">up Main St</a>.)</p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s a really interesting article; it&#8217;s quite critical of the game in terms of minute geographic accuracy, but the nature of the criticisms he makes seem so picky that it&#8217;s clear that in the broad sense, at least, the city is very accurately recreated. If his complaints are mainly that signs exist that didn&#8217;t exist until the early 50&#8217;s, or that there were stairs rather than a road at a certain intersection, I feel pretty confident that they got the big stuff right.&nbsp;</em> </p>
<p><a title="this" href="/web/20160314090107/http://www.gamespot.com/ps3/adventure/lanoire/show_msgs.php?topic_id=m-1-59080563&amp;pid=929170&amp;tag=topics%3Btitle" target="_blank">Which</a> is a fascinating statement.&nbsp; Naturally, I would counter with the dusty old Miesian idiom &#8220;God is in the details.&#8221;&nbsp; I mean, Rockstar&#8217;s consumed with the <em>Gesamkunstwerk</em> here, and you&#8217;re going to let the details <em>slide</em>?&nbsp; Hey, I warned y&#8217;all.&nbsp; I self-confessed to nitpickery in my own text.&nbsp; To continue:</p>
<p><em>GotDAMN, I think they&#8217;re almost expecting too much out of the game with some of those nitpicks, and also don&#8217;t seem to have a firm grasp on the concept that videogames are still very much limited by the hardware. I will commend him on the amount of information in that article, but it&#8217;s a little overboard IMO. And with no mention of the face capturing tech + hiring all these actors to actually play their parts, someone should tell him that the huge budget he mentioned couldn&#8217;t all go towards recreating a perfect 1947 LA brick by brick.</em></p>
<p><em>I got that he still enjoyed it, but I feel like maybe if he stated some of his complaints in front of the Rockstar reps, they could&#8217;ve or should&#8217;ve explained how they couldn&#8217;t afford to focus on recreating a 100% perfect city because they&#8217;re building a GAME, and not a 1947 LA simulator. While he does point out that he pushed the &#8220;game aspects&#8221; to the background for that article since that&#8217;s not where his areas of expertise lie, I think doing that does a disservice to just how much work the team has to do when making all this stuff.</em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;d like to hear his opinion of the game after he puts 20 hours into it, and whether or not he&#8217;s still looking at what&#8217;s NOT there instead of the whole picture.</em></p>
<p><em>I see where you&#8217;re coming from, but he explicitly noted he had no idea about video games or the industry, and was really only brought in to sample the world, not the game.</em></p>
<p><em>I think he was credited as a consultant too, so he probably invested considerable emotion regarding the ultimate recreation of LA.</em></p>
<p>I agree with everything <a title="LAgrasponAnything" href="/web/20160314090107/http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=428479&amp;page=2" target="_blank">said above</a>:&nbsp; quite sure I&#8217;m expecting too much, nor do I have a firm grasp <em>on anything</em>, plus LA can&#8217;t be recreated brick by brick, and no, it&#8217;s not a simulator, etc.&nbsp; On the other hand, in case it didn&#8217;t come through, I want it known that I laud Team Responsible to no end.&nbsp; Could <em>I</em> have constructed such a world?&nbsp; Hella course not.&nbsp; Let it be known I am eternally grateful and thankful to those who did.&nbsp; Now, will I be a &#8220;whole picture&#8221; guy after twenty hours of gameplay, as to which commenter above alluded?&nbsp; We&#8217;ll see.&nbsp; </p>
<p>And to set the record straight on that last sentence, no, yours truly was not a consultant.&nbsp; That notwithstanding, I&#8217;ll own up to that &#8220;he probably invested considerable emotion regarding the ultimate recreation of LA&#8221; part.&nbsp; I mean, they&#8217;d <a title="perfect" href="/web/20160314090107/http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/adventure/lanoire/news.html?sid=6158609" target="_blank">announced</a> their &#8220;perfect recreation&#8221; in September of &#8217;06.&nbsp; And considerable emotion had already been invested in the <a title="chitwood" href="/web/20160314090107/http://1947project.blogspot.com/2006/01/loose-lips-sink-ships.html" target="_blank">Chitwood</a> <a title="chitwood2" href="/web/20160314090107/http://1947project.blogspot.com/2006/01/203rd-and-western-to-day.html" target="_blank">case</a> and now we&#8217;re honored to have gamers discover it <a title="chitwood3" href="/web/20160314090107/http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/15501/the-real-crimes-behind-la-noire-cases-a-marriage-made-in-heaven.html" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp; Or take <a title="EW" href="/web/20160314090107/http://1947project.blogspot.com/2006/02/phoney-baloney.html" target="_blank">Eugene White</a>:&nbsp; close to <a title="hearts4you" href="/web/20160314090107/http://1947project.blogspot.com/2006/02/gifts-for-missus.html" target="_blank">my heart</a>, a non-criminal whose <a title="ewww" href="/web/20160314090107/http://www.la-noire.net/forums/thread-23.html" target="_blank">story</a> included his wife to the detriment of his progeny<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">â€”</span>R*/Bondi later decided, in true noir form, to change White to <a title="cracker!" href="/web/20160314090107/http://lanoire.wikia.com/wiki/Adrian_Black" target="_blank">Black</a>&#8230;and lest we forget the <a title="o'connor" href="/web/20160314090107/http://1947project.blogspot.com/2006/02/terrible-blast.html" target="_blank">O&#8217;Connor </a>Electroplating <a title="Oconnor" href="/web/20160314090107/http://1947project.blogspot.com/2006/02/926-east-pico-to-day.html" target="_blank">Explosion,</a> which I&#8217;m off to inundate myself with <a title="electro" href="/web/20160314090107/http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2011/05/16/best-buy-giving-away-free-la-noire-dlc-tonight/" target="_blank">now</a>&#8230;like sand through the hourglass, these are the kills of our lives.&nbsp; Should have you know I&#8217;m not the<a title="dahlialink" href="/web/20160314090107/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/thedailymirror/2011/05/another-good-story-ruined-the-black-dahlia.html" target="_blank"> only one </a>with my ear pressed close to the beating heart of 1947 and her legacy.</p>
<p>Historical knowledge will always at best be an approximation of the past.&nbsp; I know that.&nbsp; Clio alone possesses the real truth, and she will only allow us a glimpse of her treasure.&nbsp; The WPA maps, the Spence Air Photos, the <a title="images" href="/web/20160314090107/http://articles.latimes.com/2011/apr/24/entertainment/la-ca-noir-city-20110424/2" target="_blank">180,000 photos </a>Bondi surveyed (ok, I raise an eyebrow at that number) show the dedication to which they aspired.&nbsp; It&#8217;s refreshing, since kids today seem to be under the spell of Antoine Roquentin or the influence of Paul ValÃ©ry.&nbsp; History may be an argument without end, granted; but history is no less potent than our present, and when it is skewed, so skewed is our present.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Thus go the criticisms of <em>47PplaysLANoire</em>, they are many and varied, but at least they all recognize what I strove to point out:&nbsp; <em>I&#8217;m no gamer</em>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Even that concept gets called to the carpet.&nbsp; Was lunching the other day with a pal, and the subject of my virgin PS3 came up, and I ran through my Luddite rap, blah dee blah, which at this point I admit now sounds like so much shtick. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Politely ignoring me, my friend asked â€œHow are <em>you</em> of all people not a gamer?â€</p>
<p>â€œHow do you mean?â€</p>
<p>â€œYouâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />re always going on about the zombie apocalypse<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">â€”</span>â€</p>
<p>â€œ<em>Forthcoming</em> zombie apocalypse,â€ I corrected.</p>
<p>â€œWhatever.&nbsp; Youâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ve worked through a hundred ways to defeat zombies.&nbsp; Then thereâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s your contingency plan for alien incursion or if the city is overrun by spies.&nbsp; Or Nazis.&nbsp; Or robots.&nbsp; Youâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />re a dedicated firearm enthusiast, and on entering a room you take stock of its exits and supplies.&nbsp; Didnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t you once say that on entering a room you rank it on whom you can leave behind, but youâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d never leave behind ammo?â€</p>
<p>â€œThatâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s just common sense.&nbsp; You gonna finish your fries?â€</p>
<p>â€œNot to mention that thing you do where you sit motionless staring at a screen, tapping away, for days on end.&nbsp; Classic gamer action.â€</p>
<p>â€œWhose clinical name is hyperfocus.&nbsp; Blessing and a curse.&nbsp; Tell your <em>gamer</em> friends itâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s playing havoc with their dopamine levels.â€</p>
<p>Most men memorize NBA stats, and do so in the hope they&#8217;ll get to use them<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">:&nbsp; </span>bar bet-winning material.&nbsp; But zombie killing tactics and SERE training is akin to having that gun in the nightstand<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">â€”</span>it&#8217;s there with the hope that it never, ever provides utility.&nbsp; Relatedly, why would I devote my days immersed in some blood-drenched environment, a titanic flatscreen taking me through that world I so desperately wish to avoid?&nbsp; I have enough problems with my nightmares.&nbsp; I donâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t even set foot into my local market any more because Iâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />m certain Y&#8217;golonac is the manager there.&nbsp; </p>
<p>But I can&#8217;t turn a blind eye to LA Noire.&nbsp; The concept is too engrossing, my need too enveloping.&nbsp; I wrote in my previous piece of the game&#8217;s relationship to historiography.&nbsp; At this point, in a fever to amble into 1947, any further writing on the subject would more be akin to hagiography.&nbsp; After which the aforementioned &#8220;painful&#8221; epithet would be hurled with deserved, less subjective abandon.&nbsp; </p>
<p>So tomorrow begins.&nbsp; I know it will be a succulent adventure, thick with wonder; at its best, I know it will be an interesting/painful journey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all I ever asked.</p>
