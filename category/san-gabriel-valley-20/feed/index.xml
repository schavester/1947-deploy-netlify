<p>Gentle reader,</p>
<p>What are you doing Saturday afternoon? Will you be among the lucky citizens exploring the strange secrets of the San Gabriel Valley and feasting on juicy dumplings on a concrete sea monster, or will you bored and kicking yourself for not getting on the Crime Bus? Read on for all you need to know to avoid that sad fate.<br />&nbsp;<br />For this Saturday, September 29, Esotouric&#8217;s Crime Bus offers a rare edition of its wackiest true crime and history tour, Blood &amp; Dumplings. Tickets for the four-to-five hour luxury coach tour, including dumplings, are $60. Heading due East out of downtown for points rarely seen, the tour explores several historic communities that reflect the growth and eccentricity that are hallmarks of 20th century Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Crime Bus passengers will be treated to detailed descriptions of some of the most notorious, strange and fascinating forgotten tales from the past hundred years, each told at the scene of the crime. They&#8217;ll thrill to the freakish case of the Man from Mars Bandit who stalked area supermarkets for months in 1951 before meeting his match in a police sharpshooter, shock to discover the deadly infighting among El Monte&#8217;s American Nazi Party members, mourn the Case of the Buried Bride dragged beneath her home on her wedding day by her secret lover, gnash teeth at the weird lion farm (home to every MGM lion) that served lion meat barbecues on special occasions, and visit scenes of notorious cases including Phil Spector&#8217;s spooky hilltop castle, James Ellroy&#8217;s murder victim mother Geneva (the true-life inspiration for his Black Dahlia novel), neglected Manson victim Steve Parent and even an obscure East LA link to the JFK assassination.<br />&nbsp;<br />And since no visit to the San Gabriel Valley is complete without a delicious Chinese meal, the Crime Bus will stop at 101 Noodle Express (one of Jonathan Gold&#8217;s picks for 99 L.A. restaurants not to be missed) to pick up a dumpling feast, which will be enjoyed picnic-style at Monster Park, a remarkable sea-themed folk art environment recently saved from demolition. There passengers can enjoy their snack in the mouth of a concrete whale, or under a grinning octopus, then pose for photos with the creatures. </p>
<p>All this, plus stunning mid-century trailer parks, subterranean Black Panther hideouts, wild shootouts, dope-dealing druggists, missing Salvador Dali paintings, the original&nbsp; &quot;little girl down a well&quot; television sensation, and a very strange story about ducks.</p>
<p>This tour is my personal favorite of all our tours, packed with more offbeat history, horror, roadside architecture and fabulous Route 66 vistas than any other. We don&#8217;t offer it very often, and I highly recommend it to anyone who has been thinking about getting on the Crime Bus.</p>
<p>And don&#8217;t forget, we offer 15% discounts for KCRW members, gift certificates, and Season Pass deals ($30 off four tours for one person) that can be applied retroactively for recent passengers. </p>
<p>For more info on Esotouric, or to reserve your seat, visit<br /><a href="https://www.esotouric.com/" target="_blank">https://www.esotouric.com/</a> <br />&nbsp;<br />Upcoming Esotouric bus tour schedule:<br />Sat Sept 29 &ndash; Blood &amp; Dumplings (San Gabriel Valley true crime tour)<br />Sun Oct 7&ndash; Reyner Banham Loves Los Angeles (architecture/urbanism tour)<br />Sat Oct 20&ndash; The Real Black Dahlia tour<br />Sun Oct 21 &ndash; Where the Action Was (rock history tour)<br />Sat Oct 27 &ndash; Haunts of a Dirty Old Man: Charles Bukowski&#8217;s LA<br />Sun Oct 28 &ndash; Hallowe&#8217;en Horrors featuring Crimebo the Clown</p>

<p>This has been a mad, felony fueled day in the Southland, and there isn&rsquo;t even a full moon! We have four tales of crime including a beating, triple poisoning, robbery and assault, and finally the murder of a policeman in Arcadia by three wayward youths. Read them at your leisure, or devour them all at once.</p>

No trace of her alleged assailant has been found. The young woman&rsquo;s injuries are critical and it is feared that she may die. </p>

The couple&rsquo;s servant, Ray Tayama, is being sought in connection with the crime.

<p>Are these the only cases from the police blotter today? Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous! The mayhem continues&hellip; </p>

<p>Ex-con and bail jumper Paul Knapp spent the day in the arms of his lovely wife Josephine, while she tenderly patted his cheek and vociferously<img loading="lazy" width="132" height="240" border="0" align="right" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1079/940826114_18cb638ac5_m.jpg" alt="Paul Knapp" title="Paul Knapp" /> declared his innocence of robbery and assault. Josephine may be confident that her husband is guiltless of the charges against him, but his record speaks persuasively to a life of crime.</p>
<p>Paul was a cop in Seattle from 1919 until 1923 when he was dismissed for being absent without leave, refusal to obey orders, and for participating in a liquor hi-jacking. He was busted in Los Angeles in 1924 for attacking a woman, but he fled before he could be tried. By 1925 he was in Portland doing fifteen months in McNeil Island Federal pen for impersonating a Federal officer. </p>
<p>In April of this year, after vowing to shoot it out with the law, he was cornered by police and wounded in the shoulder. He was booked on suspicion of robbery and as a fugitive from justice. As if those charges weren&rsquo;t enough, he was also wanted in Seattle for jumping bail and in Portland for violation of the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann_Act" title="Mann Act">Mann Act</a>! </p>
<p>Earlier this month, a court order allowed the bandit to be released into the custody of two deputy sheriffs so that he could visit a dentist &ndash; whose office was conveniently located across the street from his mother&rsquo;s house. Paul asked his custodians if he could be allowed to use the bathroom at his mother&rsquo;s place. The police acquiesced, and once inside the <img loading="lazy" width="134" height="240" border="0" align="left" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1411/940838444_d227e63cd0_m.jpg" alt="Josephine Knapp" title="Josephine Knapp" />house the bandit&rsquo;s cagey spouse and his wily mother engineered his escape through a trap door in the closet of the home, while the clueless officers continued to wait for him outside! </p>
<p>Following his escape, Paul and Josephine reunited and hid out in a small apartment at <a target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=1057+S+New+Hampshire+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+Los+Angeles,+California+90006,+United+States&#038;sll=34.164259,-118.239622&#038;sspn=0.009197,0.023389&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;cd=1&#038;mpnum=0&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" title="1057 South New Hampshire">1057 South New Hampshire</a> which had been rented for them by an accomplice known to police. On a hunch, Detective Lieutenant Hull of the Central Police Station investigated and found Paul and his wife at the apartment. The couple&rsquo;s crime partner is being hunted. </p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s mother and his wife have been accused of conspiracy for engineering his Houdini-like escape. A glimpse into the future finds Paul sentenced to from sixteen years to life in the state pen. His mother and his wife will seek probation, but no word if they&rsquo;ll be successful. </p>

<p>Our final story for this summer day in July of 1927 is a tale of flaming youth and flaming guns! <img loading="lazy" width="126" height="234" border="0" align="right" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1180/940826108_de221a8c0c_m.jpg" alt="Frank Miller" title="Frank Miller" /></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" width="128" height="230" border="0" align="left" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1157/940838472_9eceb851c3_m.jpg" alt="Ray Oddell" title="Ray Oddell" />The three boys have been friends since meeting in the State reform school at Ione. Both Oddell and Montfort credit Miller with being the brains of the outfit and insist it was he who formed the plan to rob a barbeque stand in <a target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=Arcadia,+California,+United+States&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=12&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" title="Arcadia">Arcadia</a>, which resulted in the shooting death of Officer Alfred Mathias. </p>
<p>The boys were sitting in the stolen automobile when they were approached by Officer Mathias. The cop asked Oddell for the car&rsquo;s registration. Miller spoke from the back seat and told the officer he had the pink slip. Mathias thought the young man was acting suspiciously and asked &ldquo;what are you sitting on?&rdquo; Frank whipped out his gun and demanded that the officer &ldquo;stick &lsquo;em up&rdquo;. Mathias bolted and headed for the rear of the car as Frank fired, leaving the policeman dead in the parking lot. <img loading="lazy" width="126" height="233" border="0" align="right" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1141/940838520_4d2ccfc016_m.jpg" alt="William Montfort" title="William Montfort" /></p>
<p>Set the time machine for two months hence; September 1927. Frank Miller will plead guilty to murder and auto theft and will be found guilty. He&rsquo;ll be lucky. The jury will recommend that the youth not hang, but rather spend one year to life in San Quentin. Frank&rsquo;s partners in crime Ray Oddell and William Montfort, will face similar fates. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The flaming youths burned out&hellip;and so have we! What a day! </p>

<p>Quick, fellas, hop in the car! We gotta get out to El Monte pronto, or there won&#8217;t be any of the main course left. What, you mean you call yourself a Lion and you don&#8217;t want to sample a hunk of barbecued adolescent lion meat, personally prepared by the King of Beasts&#8217; best pal Charles Gay out at his Lion Farm, as part of the celebration of the charters of the El Monte and Alhambra clubs? Getouttahere! Of course you do!</p>

We&#8217;ll sit at the big table in the middle of the lion cages, drink up some hooch and gnaw on a cat bone while telling dirty jokes and practicing our roars. And then, when we&#8217;re all good and lit up, Gay&#8217;ll bring Numa, his biggest and friendliest lion out to walk the length of the table, and we&#8217;ll toast that kitty as he&#8217;s never been toasted before.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the spirit, fellas, out we go. This is a big day for the Lions of Southern California, one we&#8217;ll tell our grandkids about!</p>

<p>Car dealer R.C. Kane thought he was about to close a sale, and perhaps was leaning back with an air of satisfaction when the would-be buyer, Mrs. R.N. Upton, became startled at an intersection as another car approached. </p>
<p>She went for the brake, but hit the gas, and the car careened into Judge F.W. Houser&#8217;s yard and smacked into a concrete post. Kane and Upton, in the front seats, both went through the windshield and were severely cut and lacerated. In the back, Kane&#8217;s wife went out the window, and like Dwight Lesley was cut and bruised. The car was wrecked: NO SALE!</p>
<p>The victims were sent to Alhambra Hospital for treatment&mdash;all save Mrs. Upton, who insisted on seeing a Christian Science practitioner. <br /><a title="Photo Sharing" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/535855962/"><img loading="lazy" width="399" height="305" border="0" alt="grace coolidge with pet raccoon rebecca, 1923" src="//farm1.static.flickr.com/251/535855962_04fadd0d04_o.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., President and Mrs. Coolidge&#8217;s pet raccoon Rebecca, a beloved pardon case from the White House larder one Thanksgiving, escaped and led staff on a two hour spree around the trees of the temporary White House, before climbing down and nonchalantly returning to her stump behind the residence. For more about the Coolidge&#8217;s interesting pets, see <a href="https://www.davidpietrusza.com/coolidge-pets.html" target="_blank">this article</a>, with much on Rebecca towards the end.</p>

<p><em>Whoo-Whoo!</em> Get outta the road, here comes a cop, or an ambulance. Jeez, usually they drive better than that. This guy doesn&#8217;t give an inch. Muscling his way south through heavy Vermont Avenue traffic after midnight in his Essex, he pushes through the Third, Sixth and Seventh intersections with only some shattered nerves and shouted curses. </p>
<p>By this point he&#8217;s picked up a tail, Detective Lieutenant Vanaken riding with Auto Club man Harry Raymond, who wonder what the deuce this yutz thinks he&#8217;s doing, and if this could be the same siren-happy individual who&#8217;s been reported around town these past three weeks. And then at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=wilshire+and+vermont,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=55.937499,101.425781&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.063326,-118.291533&#038;spn=0.007235,0.012381&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">Wilshire</a>, the inevitable sickening crash of metal on metal, leaving A.J. Hanker and cabbie Oscar Ruiz, thankfully uninjured, sitting in their wrecked cars as Vanaken forces the automotive bully to the curb a block south. </p>
<p>Inside, Dr. R.B. King, 25, X-ray technician out Alhambra way, who denies causing the accident, though he admits he used his siren while not on an official call. Well, since he&#8217;s a doctor, they book King on charges of failing to stop and render aid at an accident scene, and hold him in the City Jail. Meanwhile, we trust, police mechanics are cutting that siren off the Essex, and none to carefully, either.</div>

<p>Why yes, Pasadenans, that <em>was</em> our own Nathan Marsak glowering out at you from page three of the Sunday paper, doing his little AH impression on the former site of the American Nazi Party Headquarters in deepest El Monte, as part of the Blood and Dumplings Crime Bus Tour. To read Molly R. Okean&#8217;s story, which oddly enough in the web version doesn&#8217;t feature Sarah Reingewirtz&#8217; striking photograph, just <a href="https://www.pasadenastarnews.com/news/ci_5464230" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>
<p>We had a great day exploring the San Gabriel Valley with a bus full of charming passengers, including a stop for dumplings at Monster Park (sorry about the soy sauce shortage!), turn-of-the-century bungalow poetry from co-host Richard Schave, black cats crossing our paths and some truly chilling tales of forgotten crimes and misfortunes. Thanks to everyone who joined us, especially Sister Kelly and Brother Nathan, and watch this space for announcements of upcoming tours, criminal and otherwise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If there&#8217;s one thing we at 1947project love even more than uncovering<br />  evidence of an incredibly weird forgotten crime, it&#8217;s Chinese<br />  food&#8211;especially dumplings! Whether fried or boiled, stuffed with<br />  shrimp, pork, pumpkin, fish, scallions or sometimes a little dollop of<br />  soup, nothing is more comforting and delicious.</p>
<p>  With <strong>Blood &amp; Dumplings</strong>, we&#8217;re combining our favorite things to bring<br />  you the first new Crime Bus tour of 2007, a a grim and gleeful descent<br />  into the criminal history of the San Gabriel Valley, including the battling Nazis of El Monte, the chilling (and probably incestuous) Case of the Buried Bride, missing Salvador Dali paintings, the dark history of the Lions Club&#8217;s lion meat BBQs held in eye- and nose-range of hundreds of the lovely beasts, the Man from Mars Bandit (his mystery revealed!), plus Phil Spector, neglected Manson victim Steve Parent, Geneva Ellroy and a peculiar East L.A. link to the JFK assassination, concealed Black Panthers and the coolest trailer parks in the Southland.</p>
<p>Included in the $55 ticket price is a special stop for Chinese comfort food at one of the best dumpling joints in Monterey Park&nbsp; and an afternoon picnic surrounded by real sea monsters.</p>
