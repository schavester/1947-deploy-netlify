<div>January 10, 1927<br />Unincorporated Los Angeles</p>
<p>Sheriff&#8217;s officers responded to a desperate cry of murder after a corpse was found by oil field workers digging ditches in Brea, but when they investigated they determined it was merely the aged skeleton of an Indian, disinterred from his ancient grave. The corpse was reburied without ceremony, and the diggers advised to avoid the spot in the future.</p>
<p>And in another Sheriff&#8217;s case with a fresher body, the peculiar suicide by gun of Charles Norton, shopkeeper at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=1760+East+Slauson,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=34.09816,-118.28956&#038;sspn=0.00741,0.014205&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=33.990484,-118.307905&#038;spn=0.007419,0.014205&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">1760 East Slauson</a>, was explained away rather ingeniously. Why was the man found dead in his bed in the store&#8217;s back room, when his brother said he had no reason to do away with himself? Deputy Sheriff Hackett believes the cause was a nightmare, triggered by the story &quot;Shooting Mad&quot; in the Wild West-themed magazine lying beside the dead man. Hackett suggests Norton dozed off while reading, dreamed a gunman was in the room, reached under the pillow for his own weapon and inadvertently shot himself. Stranger things have happened in Los Angeles.</div>

<p>Those of you who have taken a club to an elderly woman know, that&rsquo;s six months in County.&nbsp; Everybody knows that.&nbsp; And just as those of us who have wielded a pool cue at a mother-in-law are looking at the ol&rsquo; six mos and that $500 ($5,515 USD2007) fine, that&#8217;s what shoulda faced Anaheim&rsquo;s Walter J. Jewell&mdash;except in his case there were <em>extenuating circumstances</em>.</p>
<p>You see, he&rsquo;s a man who loves his children.&nbsp; He <em>wuvs</em> them.&nbsp; In that bloodlusty kinda way.</p>
<p>Seems that Jewell arrived at wifey&rsquo;s house (they&rsquo;re separated) to pick up the kids for the customary week-end visit.&nbsp; But despite his being a prominent citizen, he just doesn&rsquo;t see fit to pay his alimony, which sent wifey&rsquo;s mother&mdash;the aforementioned mother-in-law&mdash;into a huff.&nbsp; Crone in question, Mrs. Marion Blake, also of Anaheim, refused to allow Jewell possession of the youngsters.&nbsp; Enraged, Jewell rushed back to his auto and retrieved his trusty billiard cue.&nbsp; Back in the house he did, though, stop short at cracking her skull open like a soft-boiled egg. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The court informed Mrs. Blake that it was &ldquo;inadvisable&rdquo; to take the law into her own hands&mdash;that would be apparent.&nbsp; Mr. Jewell was scolded that he was &ldquo;old enough to know better&rdquo; than to &ldquo;assault an aged woman with a club.&rdquo;&nbsp; That may be.&nbsp; In any event, because everyone loves children so durn much, Judge Ames decided to knock Jewell&rsquo;s punishment down to ninety days and nix the fine.&nbsp; Awwwww.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="body">
<div>
<div align="left"><img loading="lazy" width="222" height="240" border="0" align="right" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2191/1721910031_b990d2da66_m.jpg" alt="doctor1" title="doctor1" />Rex H.W. Albrexstondare was not a doctor, but he played one in Southern California.</p>
<p>The pseudo-scientist claimed that he&#8217;d discovered the fountain of youth through proper diet and treatment, and had been restored from a 90-year-old man to a young man with a thick head of black hair.&nbsp; He said he&#8217;d grown four sets of teeth in his life.&nbsp; He was associated with a scheme to create a human body, saying he&#8217;d once crafted a 6 inch body, but had been unable to vivify it.&nbsp;&nbsp; He said he&#8217;d discovered a medicinal herb that could rejuvenate human life.&nbsp; And he claimed to be a Russian prince who had made millions during the regime of the Czar by devising a system of hydrating food.</p>
<p>Yes, Rex H.W. Albrexstondare said a lot of things, and oddly, some people believed him.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the &quot;doctor&quot; made his living by preying upon women, preferably of the wealthy and lonely variety, and supposedly treating them for vague medical complaints, such as headaches and rheumatism.&nbsp; However thin his ruse may seem, the doctor found plenty of willing customers until 1923, when he hit a patch of very bad luck.</p>
<p>It was then that Albrexstondare treated two Orange girls, Myrtle Thompson and Evelyn Rohrs, who suffered from congenital heart disorders.&nbsp; He gave them a paste made of mashed vegetables, alfalfa, and pea pods, which probably did the girls no direct harm, but certainly did them no good either.&nbsp; Albrexstondare was charged with practicing medicine without a license.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="145" height="279" border="0" align="left" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2107/1721910307_4c2e628f7f_o.jpg" alt="doctor2" title="doctor2" />Around the same time, a suit was brought by Jennie McFadden, a wealthy Altadena widow, who claimed that Albrexstondare had failed to repay over $20,000 in loans she&#8217;d given him over the space of a few months.&nbsp; He had befriended her, announced plans to embark on a course of scientific research, and set up a lab in her home.&nbsp; She periodically loaned him sums of money, which he perceived as gifts; he also claimed that during his stay, the 70-year-old McFadden made passes at him and tried to get him to marry her, as did her daughter.</p>
<p>Others came out of the woodwork, and by the middle of 1924, Albrexstondare had three suits filed against him totaling over $35,000.</p>
<p>But first things first.&nbsp; He was found guilty of the case involving the Orange girls (the jury&#8217;s deliberation took only 5 minutes), and was sentenced to 180 days in prison.&nbsp; He promptly set about raising the $3000 bond for his release.&nbsp; There was no mention of the party who&#8217;d finally given Albrexstondare the money for his bond, but he or she must have been too embarrassed to make a stink about it when he failed to appear for his sentence in May of 1925.&nbsp; On the lam for three months, he was finally apprehended in Ensenada and dragged back to Orange County to serve his sentence.</p>
<p>Then in December 1926, things took a turn for the weird.&nbsp; Socialite and pianist Ruth Shaw, one of the women who&#8217;d previously filed suit against Albrexstondare back in 1924, pledged her loyalty to him and agree to help him with his legal troubles.&nbsp; This would mark the beginning of Shaw&#8217;s second career as a professional swindler and full-time accomplice.</p>
<p>For reasons that were not specified, Jennie McFadden&#8217;s case did not come to trial until October of 1927, but Albrexstondare&#8217;s performance there may have been worth the wait.&nbsp; Prior to the trial, he and Shaw had hinted that they had some surprises up their sleeves, and today, the doctor let out all the stops.</p>
<p> He claimed that he was beaten so severely in prison that he lost his hearing, memory, and consciousness of his surroundings for nine months.&nbsp; He said that Jennie McFadden and her daughter had threatened to use their wealth and influence to have him arrested, and that McFadden herself had engaged the agents who followed him from San Diego to New York City and finally, to Mexico while he was a fugitive (although he never saw himself that way).</p>
<p>The judge didn&#8217;t see it this way, however, and ordered that Albrexstondare repay Mrs. McFadden&#8217;s money with 7% interest, as well as all court costs.&nbsp; You might that all of this would teach the doctor a lesson, or at least slow him down; however, Albrexstondare continued his schemes in Los Angeles with little variation or discretion for at least the next seven years.</p>
<p>In May 1930, he was in trouble again, accused of swindling a woman who said she&#8217;d paid $275 for a medical treatment that she never received.&nbsp; Ruth Shaw, who&#8217;d lined up a string of gullible female clients for the doctor, was charged as an accomplice.&nbsp; Last heard from in 1934, the pair were still up to their old tricks.&nbsp; They were again charged with swindling for their efforts to separate L.A. residents from their hard-earned cash, telling them that they were raising funds to file a federal suit &#8212; allegedly, the $43 million fortune of the deceased Czar had been deposited to a San Francisco bank.</p>
<p>And is it just my imagination, or does our own Nathan Marsak bear some small resemblance to the good doctor?&nbsp; Watch he doesn&#8217;t slip you any vegetable paste!</div>

<p><img loading="lazy" width="234" height="142" border="0" align="right" title="costshome" alt="costshome" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1182/866397398_7a30e00083_o.gif" />Mrs. Geraldine Haster was a product of her time&mdash;too bad her time was so terribly and sinfully debased!&nbsp; It was bad enough that she had taken to wearing cosmetics (!) but <em>then</em> she had even gone so far as to bob her hair (!!)!&nbsp; Why not just tattoo &quot;SCAPEGRACE&quot; across your forehead, Geraldine?</p>
<p>When Geraldine returned with her mother and a party of friends from a motor trip to Tijuana (need we say more?) she found herself locked out of the home she shared with her husband, prominent Anaheim rancher Richard Haster.&nbsp; Geraldine filed for divorce, charging cruelty.</p>
<p>On the stand today Geraldine alleged that life with ol&rsquo; Dick was no picnic either:&nbsp; he took liberties with other women, was adverse to frequent bathing, read magazines while guests were in the house (!!!), stayed at the lodge until 4am, and, most hurtful of all, when she wore cosmetics, was told by her husband that she looked like a &ldquo;Piute Indian.&rdquo;&nbsp; She thus demands division of property valued at $100,000 ($1,102,998 USD 2006).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="273" height="126" border="0" align="left" title="lutherans!" alt="lutherans!" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1268/866392664_f3301aa397_o.gif" />Yes, the twenties were a time of tumult and turmoil as conventions unraveled, exposing lots of hypocrisy and kicked-up heels.&nbsp; Lutherans took especial offence at all this gayety, closing their thirty-fifth annual convention today with the adoption of a resolution deploring the tendency of American youth toward &ldquo;extravagance, immodesty, and disrespect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lutherans sleep easy tonight knowing that American youth turned out <em>just fine</em>.</p>

<p>Scholars of the unexplained in America will be familiar with the legend of the <a href="https://www.prairieghosts.com/gasser.html" target="_blank">Mad Gasser of Mattoon</a>, a possibly imaginary figure who gassed his way across two communities over a decade and thence into the spooky books.</p>
<p>But we&#8217;ve found a precedent in the Los Angeles area that beats the first Mad Gasser attacks by six years! This very evening, garage operator Alois Sabinski was asleep in his home at 111 North Nicholas Street when his wife was roused by the distinctive odor of chloroform, and discovered her husband in a swoon. The clever lady threw open all the windows to disperse the poison before she too was rendered insensible, and peeked outside to see a man running away carrying what looked like a bicycle pump. A bicycle pump of doom!</p>
<p>Officer Roy Mills, called to the scene, found footprints under the window and on the porch, and evidence that the gasser had launched his fumes through the open transom. So close those transoms, kids, and beware strange men bearing pumps.</div>

<p>May 10, 1927<br />Santa Ana</p>
<p>Then as now, avocados are expensive and desirable treats, and a produce man will find his business flourishing when his expenses are limited to gasoline for midnight raids on Orange County orchards and bullets for his gun. </p>
<p>But the men of the Avocado Grower&#8217;s Association breathe easier tonight after the arrest of Louis Chiuma at his produce stand at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=2301+W+1st+St,+Santa+Ana,+Orange,+California+92703,+United+States&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=58.99189,105.644531&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;cd=3&#038;ll=33.746645,-117.899995&#038;spn=0.007672,0.012896&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">2301 West First Street.</a> Chiuma and his associates are believed to be among the gangs of alligator pear snatchers who have absconded with $50,000 worth of the fruit so far this year. Recently, two men raided the Lindauer Ranch in La Habra and dropped their sacks to engage the night watchman in a gunfight. No one was hit, and the guard reported their truck license to County Sheriffs, which led them to Chiuma.</p>
<p>Back in the suspect&#8217;s rooms, sheriffs found a stash of dynamite. But what they couldn&#8217;t find was a snitch: the neighborhood clammed up quick, with some souls heard muttering about the Black Hand. That&#8217;s right: the Avocado Mafia, and don&#8217;t let me hear you tattling, or there&#8217;ll be no guacamole on your enchilada tonight or ever!</p>

<div>April 27, 1907  </p>
<div>Los Angeles</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To Carl Tabbert, it seemed a mere triviality that when eloping with his intended to Santa Ana, that the wife-to-be swear she was eighteen years of age in order to secure a marriage license.&nbsp; Today, Tabbert is in Los Angeles Superior Court, charged with rape.&nbsp; In actuality, blushing bride Virginia Spencer was all of thirteen.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Tabbert pleaded guilty, having been persuaded that he broke the law, of which he admitted some ignorance.&nbsp; While vaguely aware he had committed some offense, he had not believed it was in any way serious.&nbsp; While he awaits further hearings&mdash;wherein witnesses are expected to testify to his good character&mdash;his child-bride has been placed in the Truelove Home.</div>
