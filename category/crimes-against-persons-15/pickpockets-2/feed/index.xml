<div>May 8, 1907<br />
Los AngelesOne expects Fiesta-time to be fortuitous to the light-fingered gentry (e.g., V. S. Hawley had a $30 gold watch taken from his pocket; E. E. Leech was relieved of $7 while standing on Main Street watching the floats) but when goods are taken by the wagon-load, then we&#8217;ve got serious business afoot. No fewer than nine major break-ins were reported last night. The thieves in each case were evidently experienced operators, who feared little for being molested during their duties, especially given as in every instance the intrusion coincided with the Fiesta parades between 8pm and 12am. Further, the thieves had discriminating taste: at the home of S. H. Garrett, where entrance was gained through a rear window, purloiners went through the wardrobe and selected the finest of silk dresses and evening clothes to purloin; they even absconded with the better bedclothes. At 2629 Orchard Avenue, W. W. Taylor lost a gold watch, chain, necklace, and locket; at the same address Mrs. William Fleckenstein was relieved of her opera glasses and solid silver flask. Most astonishing was the haul from Mr. Nelson Douglas of 2500 Vermont Avenue, wherein unpacked suitcases belonging to his Shriner guests were lifted in toto. Watches, jewelry, money in the children&#8217;s bank; all are in the hands of Los Angeles&#8217; dark and shadowy underworld this day.</div>

<div>Fiesta is coming!&nbsp; And men of low standing are being swept from the streets&mdash;today one M. Lawrence was arrested on the charge of peddling worthless jewelry.&nbsp; The police are making a special effort to remove from our midst swindlers of all stripes before Fiesta.&nbsp; Sometimes they have help:&nbsp; a Mr. Johnson was admitted to Receiving Hospital with cuts and lacerations to the face; he was recognized as being C. W. Draper, the recently paroled forger.&nbsp; While attempting to sell goods to a woman at 115 North Olive Street, an unknown man leaped upon him and beat him severely.</div>
