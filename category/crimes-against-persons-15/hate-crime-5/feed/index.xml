<p>December 2, 1927<br />Hollywood</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="266" height="278" border="0" align="left" title="theclimax" alt="theclimax" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2293/2079400572_ed608e7741_o.jpg" />Mrs. Margaret Pumphrey, 27, of the <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=6727+Milner+Rd,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90068&#038;sll=34.109406,-118.334684&#038;sspn=0.008226,0.013154&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.108571,-118.334679&#038;spn=0.001028,0.001644&#038;z=19&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="6727MilnerRd">Milner Road</a> Pumphreys, was standing in her bedroom of her hillside home, preparing to go downtown, when she was approached by her white-jacketed butler.&nbsp; He asked if there were any further orders.&nbsp; Mrs. Pumphrey said there were none.</p>
<p>With that, her servant&mdash;Richard R. Ewell, 30&mdash;developed an &ldquo;insane gleam&rdquo; in his eye and approached further&hellip;whereupon Mrs. Pumphrey noticed the .45 automatic in his hand. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The chase&mdash;and fusillade of shots&mdash;began!&nbsp; Mrs. Pumphey fled through a bathroom and into an adjoining bedroom, through a hallway and down the stairs, but there&rsquo;s no running from the staff.&nbsp; They know the house better than you do.</p>
<p>The mad pursuit and firearm blasts continued from room to room to room until Margaret managed to lock herself into a downstairs bedroom.&nbsp; Ewell fired several shots into the door to break the lock, but once he heard the window open, he ran around the house to catch her escaping.&nbsp; And catch her he did&mdash;as he climbed into the window, he shot her in the side as she ran screaming out the door. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The screams alarmed neighbor Mrs. Johnstone, who came running (with her two maids in tow [also suitably armed?]) and Ewell fired upon them from the home&rsquo;s entryway&mdash;but Ewell, realizing that the alarm had been raised and his game discovered, put the barrel to his head and sent his brains all over the foyer he&rsquo;d kept so spotless the three months he&rsquo;d been under the Pumphrey&rsquo;s employ.</p>
<p>Mrs. Margaret Pumphrey (could Kaufman &amp; Ryskind have scripted a name of greater puffery?) suffered more from shock and fright (as visions of <a href="https://1947project.com/?p=2088" target="_blank" title="wrightwatch27">FLW</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pbs.org/flw/buildings/taliesin/taliesin_wright02.html" target="_blank" title="juliancarlton">former servant</a> surely flashed through her head) than from her injury; she was rushed to <a href="https://jpg3.lapl.org/pics32/00065893.jpg" target="_blank" title="HolRec">Hollywood Receiving</a> and was treated for the superficial wound and released. &nbsp;</p>
<p>According to LeRoy Bird, with whom Ewell lived at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=4307+Hooper+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90011&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=63.215425,107.753906&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.006566,-118.252158&#038;spn=0.008236,0.013154&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="EwellsPlace">4307 Hooper Avenue</a>, Philadelphia native Ewell was an industrious man of good character and habits and never had any previous trouble.&nbsp; Detective Lieutenant Mahoney contends that Ewell had probably been crazed by dope, especially as he&rsquo;d been out the night before and had acted strangely in the morning.</p>
<p>Ewell leaves a widow, Inez Ewell, in Kansas City.&nbsp; Because his death was self-inflicted, there was no inquest over the body.&nbsp; A small notebook was later found in Ewell&rsquo;s possessions, and it was greatly hoped by Captain of Detectives Slaughter to contain names of prominent Hollywood people and information about dope trafficking; but sadly for Slaughter, &ldquo;the only names in the book, the officer declares, are those of negresses and it is devoid of anything referring to narcotics or trade in the drugs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So why did Richard Ewell snap?&nbsp; If only we had some <a href="https://www.butlersandsigns.com/nebu6lisist.html" target="_blank" title="pumphreysdecoratingtastes">sign</a>.</p>

<p>That Ernest M. Branson just couldn&rsquo;t leave well enough alone.&nbsp; He was a member in good standing of <a href="https://www.iww.org/unions/iu510/sanpedro/ip1924.shtml" target="_blank" title="pedroklan">San Pedro</a> 51, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, and all was fine and hunky-dory, until he started stirring the pot with his <em>talk</em>.&nbsp; So from under the sheet came a big boot, and out went Ernest; now, Ernest says he was libeled in the written order that banished him from the Kluxers.</p>
<p>What was it ever did Ernest <em>say</em>?&nbsp; To hell with the flag?&nbsp; Hooray for Hebrews?&nbsp; Eucharist is yummy?&nbsp; Thomas Jefferson got it on with Sally Hemmings?</p>
<p>No, all he did was stir up some internal dissension inside the Klan, which resulted in his ouster (maybe he sided with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madge_Oberholtzer" target="_blank" title="oberholtzer">Madge over DC</a>.)&nbsp; That&rsquo;s gotta be the worst libel of all&mdash;accused of making mishegas in the klavern!</p>
<p>So now Ernest has filed a $25,000 ($275,749 USD2006) libel suit against none other than Exalted Cyclops Karl K. Keller. &nbsp;</p>
<p>(Yes, Karl K. Keller.&nbsp; I bet his real name was Herman Flork.)</p>

<p>March 27, 1907<br /> Los Angeles&nbsp;</p>
<p>After visiting her Chinese husband in the County Jail, Mrs. Yee Lung (also called Mrs. Frank Chew) spoke of her intention to join her beloved as he was deported, and to travel with him in the train car packed with forty other Chinese deportees for the trip up to San Francisco. </p>
<p>Special permission has been granted by the U.S. Marshall for her to ride with her husband. They will immediately board a boat to Hong Kong, and the woman may never again see her white friends relatives in this country.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lung&#8217;s friends have pleaded with her to reconsider, but she insists &quot;I trust my husband implicitly&#8230; he wouldn&#8217;t go without me, and I wouldn&#8217;t be so cruel as to ask him to.&quot; </p>
