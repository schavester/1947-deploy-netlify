Venice</p>
<p>The twisted tale of Avalona Carnevale began last December 8, when the 30-year-old housewife from Venice made a phone call to her jeweler husband, Vincent. She couldn&#8217;t meet him in Los Angeles after all; he should take the street car home. And with that, she disappearedÃ¢â‚¬â€-dressed in what was described as an expensive fur coat and wearing $1800 worth of jewelry (almost $22,000 today). Vincent waited two weeks, then reported her missing, along with her car.</p>
<p>Police originally suspected foul play. Then, on January 13, the <i>Times</i> ran excerpts from a letter Avalona had written to her parents the previous week. &#8220;Honestly, Mama dear,&#8221; it read in part, &#8220;I have wanted so badly to let you know I am all right. As you know, I have been perfectly miserable the last few years and I was never contented. The climax came and I simply ran away from everything and everybody.&#8221; She was happy now, living in Long Beach with &#8220;a real he-man&#8221; named Bob. Bob, in turn, enclosed a note telling Avalona&#8217;s parents that she was &#8220;in safe and devoted hands.&#8221; </p>
<p>Happy, safe, devotedÃ¢â‚¬â€-it sounded perfectly peachy. Until today, that is, when Avalona made a statement to the police testifying that she had been lured from home by &#8220;a Barnes City circus employee&#8221; who kept her in such a state of constant intoxication that &#8220;she was by turns both unable and fearful to leave him.&#8221; It started with a few drinks in the circus man&#8217;s room. From there they went to a hotel in Culver City, where more alcohol was consumed. Her &#8220;mind was somewhat clouded from that moment on,&#8221; she told police, but her drinking buddy eventually pawned one of her bracelets for $25, which he then spent on liquor. They went to San Francisco and later to Oakland. Avalona didn&#8217;t contact police in those cities because the man beat her frequently, and she was afraid he would kill her if she tried to leave him. Eventually she did, seeking refuge in the home of Mr. and Mrs. A.M. Chisholm. Mr. Chisholm sent a telegram to Vincent Carnevale a week ago, informing him of his wife&#8217;s whereabouts. </p>
<p>That letter to her parents, the one telling them how happy she was with her &#8220;he-man&#8221; in Long Beach? Avalona told police she &#8220;faintly remembered&#8221; writing it. </p>
<p>Her husband retrieved her from Oakland (both the car and the jewels were gone) a few days ago. &#8220;She is my wife; she is in my homeÃ¢â‚¬â€-that, I think is all the evidence you need of my intentions,&#8221; Vincent Carnevale told newsmen. </p>
<p>It was a noble sentiment, but it turned out that Carnevale had signed and sworn to a divorce complaint on January 31Ã¢â‚¬â€-the day after he received notice that his wife was in Oakland. But just as Avalona couldn&#8217;t quite remember writing that damning letter to her parents, Vincent was sketchy about the divorce papers, which were filed with the court on February 7Ã¢â‚¬â€-in error, according to Carnevale. &#8220;I did not mean to have the complaint filed,&#8221; he told the <i>Times</i>. &#8220;I&#8217;d forgotten all about it in my worry and joy at finding her [his errant missus] again. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, the matter is now a closed book.&#8221; </p>
<p>And so it remains.

<div>December 25, 1927<br />
Pendleton, Oregon</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a blue Christmas for the family of Marian Parker this year, though they may take some pleasure in the knowledge that accused killer William E. Hickman tried to kill himself todayÃ¢â‚¬â€both times conveniently in front of a guard (Hickman was planning an insanity defense). The child murderer celebrated the holiday in a Pendleton, Oregon jail cell, prior to being transported back to Los Angeles for trial. Guards reported that Hickman roused himself from hours of lethargy by tearing pages from a bible and scattering them on the floor. He then asked for a handkerchief, and when his jailer obliged, quickly knotted it around his throat and pulled tight. The guard rushed into the cell, where Hickman climbed to the top of his bunk and attempted to dive headfirst to the concrete floor. The State of California  went on to accomplish what Hickman failed to on October 19, 1928.

<p>December 24, 1927<br />Los Angeles </p>
<p>Dominating newspaper headlines for the past several days has been the slaying of twelve year old school girl, Marion Parker. Her killer, William Edward Hickman, is currently in Oregon awaiting extradition. He&rsquo;ll return by train under heavy guard to Los Angeles, where he faces the death penalty for the horrific crime. </p>
<p>Long before newspapers were delivered to the doorsteps of most American homes, information was spread by song &ndash; and it&rsquo;s a practice that continues to this day. Ballads have been written about floods, mining disasters, shipwrecks, and murder. Marion Parker&rsquo;s tragic story inspired prolific song writer <a title="Rev Andrew Jenkins" href="http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-887" target="_blank">Reverend Andrew Jenkins</a> of Atlanta, Georgia to pen the poignant &ldquo;Ballad of Marian [sic] Parker&rdquo;. </p>
<p>The Ballad of Marian Parker</p>
<p>&#8216;Way out in California,<br />A family bright and gay<br />Were preparing for their Christmas<br />Not very far away.</p>
<p>They had a little daughter,<br />A sweet and pretty child.<br />And everyone who knew her<br />Loved Marian Parker&#8217;s smile.</p>
<p>She left her home one morning<br />For her school not far away.<br />And no one dreamed that danger,<br />Was lurking near that day.</p>
<p>But then a murdrous villain,<br />A fiend with heart of stone,<br />Took little Marian Parker<br />Away from friends and home.</p>
<p>The world was horror-stricken,<br />The people held their breath,<br />Until they found poor Marian,<br />Her body cold in death.</p>
<p>They hunted for the coward,<br />Young Hickman was their man.<br />They brought him back to justice,<br />His final trial to stand.</p>
<p>The jury found him guilty,<br />Of course they could not fail.<br />He must be executed<br />Soon in San Quentin jail.</p>
<p>And while he waits his sentence,<br />Let&#8217;s hope he learns to pray<br />To make his black soul ready<br />For the great judgement day.</p>
<p>There is a great commandment<br />That says, &quot;Thou shalt not kill&quot;<br />And those who do not head it,<br />Their cup of sorrow fill </p>

<p>Following up yesterday&rsquo;s story about whether one Ray McCoy was lynched for looking too much like Edward Hickman&hellip;</p>
<p>The verdict of the Coroner&rsquo;s jury?&nbsp; Jail officials and other prisoners, all vindicated.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it seems that Ralph &ldquo;Ray McCoy&rdquo; Fuller raised the ire of Angelenos in the grip of Hickman fever, whose Hickmanmania (Hickmania?&nbsp; Hickmentia?) led an angry mob to chase down and beat Fuller something fierce, believing the twenty year-old to be Hickman, after Fuller robbed a store at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=242+S+Main+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90012&#038;sll=34.050606,-118.245104&#038;sspn=0.002018,0.0036&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.051397,-118.245099&#038;spn=0.008071,0.014398&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="meyers">242 South Main</a> and was chased two blocks on foot.</p>
<p>Fellow prisoner Fred Meadows told the Times that once in the hoosegow, the sullen and reserved Fuller was regarded as just another popped burglar.&nbsp; Meadows related how he and the boys started playing &ldquo;Sundown&rdquo; in an outer tank and when he returned, Fuller had hanged himself with Meadows&rsquo; scarf.&nbsp; (Must be nice to have scarves.&nbsp; And <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/los_angeles_metro/la-me-jail27nov27,1,3016141.story?track=rss" target="_blank" title="andfreedom">pianos</a>.)</p>
<p>In other lynching news, any and all information regarding Hickman&rsquo;s departure and route from Pendleton (where he was exhibited in a cage like a circus animal) to Los Angeles County Jail is being kept under strict secrecy. &nbsp;</p>

<p>December 22, 1927<br />Los Angeles</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put up our feet and see what&rsquo;s gone on in the world this day.&nbsp; Not much.&nbsp; The odd curiosity or two.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><img loading="lazy" width="249" height="195" border="0" align="right" title="hemp" alt="hemp" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2197/2131536350_30713e4032_o.jpg" /><br />According to our concerned friends at the paper, it seems the Mexicans are making a menace of themselves, using flowers of the &ldquo;hemp&rdquo; plant as some sort of habit-forming drug (they&rsquo;re such a resourceful people!).&nbsp; Apparently the Imperial Linen Products Company has blanketed the Imperial Valley with the stuff.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;m sure the <a title="nexttheredcar" target="_blank" href="http://www.world-mysteries.com/marijuana1.htm">State</a> will sort this one out to everybody&rsquo;s satisfaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="253" height="200" border="0" align="left" title="onelastcig" alt="onelastcig" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2236/2131536354_cd46111e8d_o.jpg" />Oh dear, here&rsquo;s <a title="kaboom" target="_blank" href="https://1947project.com/?p=2189">another</a> fellow who just couldn&rsquo;t resist a final cigarette.&nbsp; Seems J. B. Smith left the wife at his <a title="jbsHouse" target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=420+west+maple,+glendale,+ca&#038;sll=34.291509,-118.432102&#038;sspn=0.016062,0.029182&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.138662,-118.261557&#038;spn=0.008045,0.014591&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1">Glendale home</a> and checked into the LaViolette Hotel on <a title="kablooie" target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=N+Maclay+Ave,+San+Fernando,+Los+Angeles,+California,+United+States&#038;sll=34.28393,-118.43869&#038;sspn=0.008031,0.014591&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;cd=1&#038;geocode=0,34.290020,-118.432120&#038;ll=34.291509,-118.432102&#038;spn=0.016062,0.029182&#038;z=15&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1">North Maclay</a> in San Fernando.&nbsp; He brought with him a stack of goodbye letters indicating his fears about going mad, and a loaf of bread&mdash;not for snacking, but for soaking in water and wadding into the wafty windows and drafty doors (my hat off again to the resourcefulness of our Southlanders).&nbsp; Of course, no-one banks on the dang&rsquo;d jets taking so <em>long</em>.&nbsp; Thankfully J. B. also brought along a pack of <a title="ifyagotem" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIN8MmMloZE">smokes</a> to pass the time&hellip;the hole blown in the wall was six feet in diameter.&nbsp; J. B.&#8217;s smoldering remains lived long enough to say goodbye to his wife at the hospital, but not much longer than that.</p>

<p>And what do have we here&hellip;a Coroner&rsquo;s inquest will be held at 1:30 today to determine whether Ralph McCoy, in City Jail on suspicion of robbery, actually hung himself in his cell or was killed by fellow prisoners&mdash;it seems McCoy bears (well, bore) a resemblance to one <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/10605329@N07/" target="_blank" title="WEH">William Edward Hickman</a>.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.&nbsp; Hickman.&nbsp; Some mention in the paper about him, too.</p>

<p>December 20, 1927<br />Los Angeles</p>
<p>As police scour the Bellevue Arms apartment*of &quot;Donald Evans&quot; (an alias for Marion Parker&#8217;s purported slayer Edward Hickman, otherwise known as The Fox), they find portions of a chocolate cake, broken golf clubs, and dirty dishes suggesting a hurried departure. Marion&#8217;s father Perry, upon discovering that the suspect is a former employee at his Seventh and Spring Street bank who he dismissed on fraud charges, says that the voice on the telephone demanding the $1500 ransom was similar to Hickman&#8217;s peculiarly blas&eacute; speech patterns when discussing his offense, but that at no time did he believe the young man meant harm to him or his family. </p>
<p>Little Marion&#8217;s outraged body lies in the morgue, a tiny, heartbreaking bundle with her missing limbs, hollowed core and unseeing eyes sewn open in doll-like pretence of life. In one small mercy, the Parker&#8217;s neighbor is the Autopsy Surgeon, and it&#8217;s this Dr. Wagner who makes the identification and pieces his little friend together from the parts that are brought in, wrapped in newspaper, from where they were scattered in Elysian Park. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The reward for The Fox&#8217; capture has swelled to $62,400, with new pledges from outraged citizens, radio stations and fraternal organizations arriving hourly. Will The Fox be snared, or will he slip away to menace other cities, other daughters? Tune in tomorrow to find out!</p>
<p>*attention, modern readers: the Bellevue Arms is the partly boarded up, expansive brick apartment building flush against the 101 freeway heading north out of downtown. The Fox&#8217; lair was upstairs in the middle rear of the Western, burned-out wing. If you decide to visit, you&#8217;ll come via Sunset Boulevard, and via&#8230; <strong>MARION</strong>.</p>

<div align="left"><img loading="lazy" width="240" height="229" border="0" align="left" title="maryholt" alt="maryholt" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2050/2121504403_d55a6591d4_m.jpg" />Superintendent of Schools Susan Dorsey spoke out on behalf of Mary Holt, registrar at the Mt. Vernon Junior High, saying, &quot;I spoke with Mrs Holt, and am satisfied that I would have acted as she did if I were confronted with the same circumstances.&quot;</p>
<p>Holt excused Marion Parker from school on Thursday, December 15 when a slender man came to the desk and asked for &quot;P.M. Parker&#8217;s youngest daughter,&quot; saying that her father had been in an automobile accident.&nbsp; Holt hesitated, knowing that Marion was a twin.&nbsp; However, the man persisted, saying, &quot;I am an employee at the bank where Mr. Parker is chief clerk, and if there is any doubt in your mind, here is the bank&#8217;s telephone number.&nbsp; You may call there.&quot;</p>
<p>Convinced, Holt sent an office assistant to get Marian from class.&nbsp; &quot;Marion was nervous and excited when I told her that her father had been injured.&nbsp; The news completely broke up a little Christmas party the children were having in their room, and Marion had some of the refreshments in her hands when she came into the room.&nbsp; But at once she forgot about everything but her father.&quot;</p>
<p>Marion was excused from school, and left with the man who would, three days later, end her life.</p>
<p>After the kidnapping, Holt said, &quot;Oh, I can think of many things I could have done now.&nbsp; I never would have let Marion go but for the apparent sincerity and disarming manner of the man.&quot;</p>
<p>Private funeral services for 12-year-old Marion Parker were held today at the Little Church of Flowers at Forest Lawn Cemetery, after which her body was cremated.&nbsp; The search for her killer continues, with police and citizens as far away as Denver and Portland on the lookout for the Fox.</p></div>

<p>December 18, 1927 <br />Los Angeles  </p>
<p>This morning&#8217;s headline was set in the giant typeface reserved for only very good or very bad news. This time it was the latter:  &quot;Kidnaped [sic] Child Slain By Fiend.&quot; For three days now, Angelenos have followed the story of 12-year-old Marian Parker, lured away from Mount Vernon High School by a man who said her father was ill. The kidnapper demanded $1500 (close to $18,000 in 2007) for her safe return, and Marian&#8217;s father agreed to pay it.   </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lperil/2122206832/" title="The suitcase by peril61, on Flickr"><img loading="lazy" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2346/2122206832_5615e008d8.jpg" width="366" height="336" ALIGN="right" alt="The suitcase" /></a></p>
<p>Shortly after 8 o&#8217;clock last night, the kidnapper drove up to the agreed-upon meeting place. Marian&#8217;s small form was visible in the passenger seat. &quot;Here&#8217;s your child,&quot; he told Parker. &quot;Give me the money and follow instructions. She&#8217;s asleep now.&quot; The ransom changed hands; the criminal drove a short way and deposited Marian&#8217;s blanket-wrapped figure on the lawn at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=432+South+Manhattan+Place,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=66.457072,103.886719&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.06729,-118.310351&#038;spn=0.008674,0.012681&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="Where Marian's body was found">432 South Manhattan Place</a>. Perry Parker rushed to his daughter, scooped her up and&mdash;in a waking nightmare that must have haunted him for the rest of his days&mdash;discovered she was dead, her eyes wired or sewn open in a hideous simulacrum of life. A wire was bound so tightly around her neck that it cut deeply into her flesh; she had been disemboweled and her legs hacked off close to her body. The <em>Times</em> was filled with stories comparing the Parker case to Leopold and Loeb and a host of other grisly child murderers. Crowds of bloodthirsty thrill seekers (the <em>Times</em> estimated over 25,000) thronged past the Parker household at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=1631+South+Wilton+Place&#038;sll=34.06729,-118.310351&#038;sspn=0.008674,0.012681&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.043734,-118.314471&#038;spn=0.008677,0.012681&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="The Parker Family Home">1631 South Wilton Place</a> (address helpfully supplied by the paper).   </p>
<p>The horror continued today. While most of Los Angeles was still reading its morning papers, citizens aiding the police found five gruesome bundles on a lonely road in Elysian Park. The first contained Marian&#8217;s arms and legs; the last, found by &quot;two small boys, carrying on the search,&quot; held her viscera. A blood-soaked suitcase previously discovered in the gutter at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=620+South+Manhattan,+los+angeles&#038;sll=34.063397,-118.31033&#038;sspn=0.008675,0.012681&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.063877,-118.31033&#038;spn=0.008675,0.012681&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="Where the suitcase was found">620 South Manhattan</a> place is believed to have held the child&#8217;s body. Then, late this evening, the police found an abandoned Ford roadster, license number 667-67. It is believed to be the automobile driven by the kidnapper to the meeting with Marian&#8217;s father.   </p>
<p>A massive manhunt is underway for the <a href=" http://markgribben.com/?p=288">fiendish killer</a>.<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lperil/2121428979/" title="A &quot;Grisly Rendezvous of Death&quot; by peril61, on Flickr"><img loading="lazy" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2241/2121428979_34477caed6.jpg" width="500" height="224" alt="A &quot;Grisly Rendezvous of Death&quot;" /></a></a></div>
