<p>October 16, 1927<br />
Los Angeles</p>
<p>His body was propped against a tree with a shotgun&#8217;s muzzle placed against what remained of his head. He had pulled the trigger with his toe. The note was terse: &#8220;Suicide. No dependents. No estate. No heirs. Please notice in New York World on Oct. 30th to print. $2 inclosed [<em>sic</em>]. Body to science, in reserve, or cremate.&#8221; It was signed &#8220;Anton K. Windsor.&#8221;</p>
<p>But who was the man found by police in <a title="Elysian Park" href="http://www.historicechopark.org/id31.html" target="_blank">Elysian Park</a> shortly after daybreak this morning? Despite the carefully printed signature on the note, police doubted his name was Anton Windsor. If it was, why had he cut all the laundry marks and labels out of his clothing? A shears and razor blade used to do the job were still in his pocket. Identification had also been removed from a <a title="Masonic Apron" href="http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/aqc/apron.html" target="_blank">Masonic apron</a> neatly folded in an inside pocket.</p>
<p>He was rich, according to detectives who cited his expensive gray business suit and outing cap, his soft hands with their careful manicure, and his faceâ€”&#8221;that of a man accustomed to easy living.&#8221; They speculated that his request to have his death noticed in the <a title="New York World" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_World" target="_blank">New York World</a> two weeks from now was a message to someone &#8220;arriving from Europe shortly before that date&#8221; or perhaps he wanted to announce his death &#8220;in connection with some public event, possibly the settling of an estate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another clue to his identity (the <em>Times</em> referred to it as the &#8220;only clew&#8221;; they apparently didn&#8217;t count his Masonic affiliation) was the &#8220;ancient&#8221; <a title="J. Manton &amp; Co." href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Manton" target="_blank">J. Manton &amp; Co.</a> shotgun he used.</p>
<p>Who were you, Anton K. Windsor?</p>
