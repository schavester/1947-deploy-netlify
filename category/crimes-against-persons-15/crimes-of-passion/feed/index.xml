<p>Kim&rsquo;s <a href="https://1947project.com/?p=2159" target="_blank" title="bundy">post </a>a few days ago about the ineffectual hammer attack led me to this tale, which ends in what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamer " target="_blank" title="gamers">those</a> of the gaming community refer to as a &ldquo;finishing move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph J. Zazala, 37, was sweet on Grace Hardesty, 35.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d been seeing her for a spell.&nbsp; They took a little ride three miles north of Berdoo.&nbsp; Perhaps he hummed a little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_My_Merry_Oldsmobile" target="_blank" title="merry">tune</a>.&nbsp; He parked.&nbsp; Maybe he&rsquo;d sneak a little smooch!&nbsp; Oh, and he brought along some <em>things</em>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The blood-and-gore stained hammer disclosed that Grace had fought, in the car, long and hard for her life, and eventually escaped.&nbsp; She was on her knees at the roadside, apparently pleading for mercy, when he put his other tool, the shotgun, in her mouth and pulled the trigger.&nbsp; He then turned the weapon on himself.</p>
<p>Sheriff Shay found letters in Grace&rsquo;s pocket indicating that while she and Ralph had been acquainted for some time, she was in fact a <em>Mrs</em>. Grace Hardesty, a fact to which Ralph evidently objected. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And so ended more love-stained, blood-stained Southern California romantic bliss.</p>
