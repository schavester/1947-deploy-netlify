<p>February 4, 1927 <br />Los Angeles </p>
<p>A police dragnet is closing in on the killers of Luther H. Green.&nbsp; A&nbsp;member of the Los Angeles Stock Exchange, Green was slain outside of his home at <a title="1053 Bonnie Brae" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=1053+south+bonnie+brae,+la,+ca&#038;sll=34.042345,-118.266076&#038;sspn=0.000942,0.001824&#038;layer=&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;om=1&#038;ll=34.060481,-118.27692&#038;spn=0.083621,0.152607&#038;z=13" target="_blank">1053 Bonnie Brae</a>, as he attempted to thwart the hijacking of his $10,000 [$120,710.34 current dollars] stash of pre-prohibition booze. He was able to fire a single shot from his rifle before being mortally wounded by the burglers. </p>
<p>According to Chief of Detectives Cline, six men have been implicated in the aborted liquor heist. It is believed that the ringleader of the failed raid may be the notorious crook, <a title="Mile Away Thomas" href="https://www.47upgradepath7.richardschave.com//node?from=315" target="_blank">Harry &ldquo;Mile-Away&rdquo; Thomas</a>. Mile-Away&rsquo;s mouthpiece, Attorney S.S. Hahn, told cops that he had conferred with his client and, &ldquo;&hellip;he was not only a <em>mile</em> away this time, but <em>sixteen</em> miles away&rdquo;. Harry and several of his confederates would soon be arrested in connection with Green&rsquo;s murder, but none of them would ever stand trial for the crime. </p>
<p>More than a decade prior to the invention of <a title="Teflon" href="https://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blteflon.htm" target="_blank">Teflon</a> &reg;, the often busted but rarely convicted non-stick felon would be released on the charges stemming from the Green killing. His lucky streak would end on the evening of April 21, 1927. Harry would be caught in a sting and gunned down by the law as he attempted to steal an expensive automobile from a private garage at <a title="1408 W 35th St" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=1408+W+35th+St,+Los+Angeles,+Los+Angeles,+California+90026,+United+States&#038;sll=34.077332,-118.262393&#038;sspn=0.022287,0.039353&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.025205,-118.296747&#038;spn=0.022301,0.039353&#038;z=15&#038;om=0" target="_blank">1408 West Thirty-Fifth Street</a>. </p>
<p>Riddled with machine-gun bullets, buckshot, and slugs from police revolvers, Harry staggered from the garage and collapsed in the arms of a uniformed officer. Mile-Away&rsquo;s last words before he succumbed to his injuries were &ldquo;Everybody has to fall some time.&rdquo; </p>

<p>The good people of Los Angeles were reminded today of a quieter, simpler time&mdash;a time known as &quot;1921&quot;.&nbsp; A magical time of Teapot Domes, and Tulsa Tumults, and shotgun blasts to the face.&nbsp; We collectively remembered the sensational <a title="21kennedyshooting" target="_blank" href="https://www.prairiepublic.org/programs/datebook/bydate/06/1006/101706.jsp">trial</a> of <a title="goodtimes" target="_blank" href="https://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E0DE1D61731EF33A2575BC0A96E9C946095D6CF">Arthur C. Burch</a> and Madalynne Obenchain, dismissed following jury disagreements, regarding the August 6, 1921 <a title="aniceplacetoraiseyourkidsupin" target="_blank" href="https://www.latimes.com/classified/realestate/printedition/la-re-guide20apr20,1,5314444.story?ctrack=1&#038;cset=true">Beverly Glen</a> shooting and .12 gauge buckshot that took apart J. Belton Kennedy&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; (And now, our obligatory Kennedy &quot;Gaelic For Ugly Head&quot; Kennedy evidence:&nbsp; the shots were fired from a clump of bushes [California:&nbsp; growing better grassy knolls since 1850]; the first shot missed; there was a beautiful woman at the scene, and mysterious tramps&#8230;anyway.)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="336" height="400" border="0" align="left" title="TwoMen" alt="TwoMen" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2046/2235650943_fbbc50e99b_o.gif" />Seems that J. Belton&rsquo;s father, John D. Kennedy, of <a title="KennedyKompound" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=844+S+Westlake+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90057&#038;sll=34.054148,-118.277087&#038;sspn=0.001947,0.003219&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.055539,-118.277092&#038;spn=0.007787,0.012875&#038;t=h&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=0">844 South Westlake</a>, never got over the death of his son, or the exoneration of the accused.&nbsp; So today the sixty two year-old is in court on the charge of assault and battery.&nbsp; He headed over to the Terminal Warehouse Building on East 7th where Burch worked in the insurance game.&nbsp; As Burch was innocently hauling some fire extinguishers from one place to another, he suddenly heard &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting a long time but now I&rsquo;ve got you!&rdquo; &ndash; and was then struck in the face and seized by the throat, but was rescued before he felt the last bit of life choked from him. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Authorities were summoned, and said Kennedy the Elder, later, &ldquo;The affair occurred when my emotions overcame me.&nbsp; I have no regrets and will gladly account for my actions at the proper time and place.&nbsp; When I went in the building no such idea entered my mind, but when I saw him [Burch] coming down the hall I could not restrain myself.<br />&ldquo;This is the fist time I have met him fact to face since his trials for the murder of my boy.&nbsp; At the sight of him I was seized with a frenzy and choked him until he began squealing and they came and separated us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe he has some pathetic obsession toward me,&rdquo; Burch declared. </p>
<p>Mrs. Obenchain, living in seclusion in Los Angeles, declined to comment on the matter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On February 21, John D. Kennedy changed his plea from not guilty to guilty and Municipal Judge Richardson gave him thirty days, suspended, with the caveat:&nbsp; that if Kennedy saw Burch coming, Kennedy was to &ldquo;go to the other side of the street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That, Kennedy said, he could do.</p>

<p>Family annihilator <a href="https://laurajames.typepad.com/clews/2005/08/if_ever_a_man_d.html" target="_blank">George Hassell</a> was convicted of killing his wife and her eight children by his late brother, and has an appointment with the Texas executioner shortly. While awaiting his last date, George recalled the wife he killed in Whittier in 1917 and the three children he buried with her beneath their little home at 236 South Whittier Avenue. There seemed no reason not to confess this, so today, with some direction from long-suspicious neighbor Myrtle Lark and a little more from the agreeable killer, Constable Bob Way crawled under the house and unearthed the body of an infant. Its mother and siblings soon followed, thus explaining the wretched odors that had long plagued the spot.</p>
<p>In slightly gayer news, the grand new Mayfair Hotel has opened in the Crown Hill district of Los Angeles, providing the ideal vantage point for a drunken oil company exec named Ray Chandler to hole up for days with his secretary while threatening suicide to all who&#8217;ll listen.</p>

<p>January 28, 1927 <br />Los Angeles </p>
<p>The hunt is on for a cop killer. Traffic Officer Parley Bennett was mortally wounded when he attempted to halt a robbery at Brodin Millinery Company. Bennett was attempting to pull out his revolver when he was shot by the bandit. His weapon discharged as he fell, but fortunately no one was injured by the stray slug. Officer Bennett was dead before he hit the floor. </p>
<p>Services for the slain officer would be held at the Brown Brothers Las Flores Chapel, <a title="935 W. Washington" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=935+West+Washington+St,+Los+Angeles,+Ca&#038;sll=34.146334,-118.185768&#038;sspn=0.037222,0.093555&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.03744,-118.2781&#038;spn=0.009317,0.023389&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=0" target="_blank">935 West Washington Street</a>, and he would be interred at <a title="Evergreen Cemetery" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=Evergreen+Cemetery,+Los+Angeles,+Ca&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.053299,-118.233833&#038;spn=0.037263,0.093555&#038;z=14&#038;om=0" target="_blank">Evergreen Cemetery</a>. </p>
<p>Parley&rsquo;s widow, Elizabeth, received $1,000 [$12,071.03 USD 2007]&nbsp;worth of police insurance, and merchants on Los Angeles Street (where Bennett died) passed the hat and collected a total of $1,071 for the bereaved woman. </p>
<p>While the fallen officer was being mourned, more that 150 policemen searched in vain for his slayer. Chief of Detectives Cline stated that the search for Parley&rsquo;s killer would continue indefinitely. </p>
<p>Although 250 suspects would be taken in for questioning, none of them would be positively identified by witnesses to the shooting. There would be the usual sightings of men answering the description of the desperado, but each suspect would ultimately be released. Eventually the leads would dry up, and Officer Bennett&rsquo;s murder would remain unsolved. </p>

<p>A short notice in the paper today about Sidney (or Sydney) Adams who, on August 2, 1925 (most likely) mortally shot his wife Annie in their home at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=1234+e+21st+st,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=66.711008,114.257813&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.023358,-118.252923&#038;spn=0.001089,0.001743&#038;t=h&#038;z=19&#038;om=0" target="_blank" title="adamsfamily">1234 East Twenty-First Street</a>.</p>

<p>January 15, 1927<br />Los Angeles  </p>
<p>The body of a young man, dressed in sailor&#8217;s togs, was found today by four children playing in an open field near <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=eighteenth+street+and+point+view+avenue,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=50.37814,103.710938&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.045246,-118.372514&#038;spn=0.00649,0.01266&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="Von Bulo's body found">Eighteenth Street and Point View Avenue</a>. The youngsters reported their gruesome discovery to the police, who identified the man as Henry Von Bulo.   </p>
<p>Von Bulo was the third member of a love triangle gone tragically wrong. (Do they ever end happily?) Last month, Curran C. Samuels, age 40, shot his wife, then turned the gun on himself. He died. The missus, though pierced by a bullet that entered her ear and exited her mouth, survived. While in the hospital, Mrs. Samuels told detectives that her husband had probably killed her friend, Henry Von Bulo. She even led them on an unsuccessful search of the vicinity in which his body was eventually found. Mrs. Samuels believes that Von Bulo was killed on December 15, as he did not keep an appointment in Long Beach on that day. Three days later, Mr. Samuels shot his wife near <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=Rossmore+Avenue+and+Wilshire+Boulevard,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=34.045246,-118.372514&#038;sspn=0.00649,0.01266&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.063432,-118.327646&#038;spn=0.006488,0.01266&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="Mrs. Samuels shot near here">Rossmore Avenue and Wilshire Boulevard</a> &quot;where she was engaged as a box-lunch saleswoman.&quot;   </p>
<p>Despite the fact that Von Bulo was dressed in sailor&#8217;s clothing and Mrs. Samuels&#8217;s assertion that he was a member of the merchant marine, Von Bulo&#8217;s stepfather declared that the young man had purchased the uniform and shoes last month in Oakland. He also suggested that his stepson might be the victim of a &quot;bootlegger&#8217;s war,&quot; but declined to further elaborate.  </p>

<p>Today, after the usual morning argument in their <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=531+Westminster+Ave,+Alhambra,+CA+91803&#038;sll=34.088457,-118.156285&#038;sspn=0.008672,0.01399&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.088457,-118.156285&#038;spn=0.008672,0.01399&#038;z=16&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="thelovenest">Alhambra home</a>, George announced he&rsquo;d had his fill, and moved his stuff out to go shack up with&hellip;a <em>widow</em>.&nbsp; Tonight Mabel followed George to <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=335+W+42nd+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90037&#038;sll=34.007529,-118.279273&#038;sspn=0.001085,0.001749&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.008185,-118.279281&#038;spn=0.00868,0.01399&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="salyerhome">335+1/2 West 42nd Street</a>, where George was involved with one Mrs. Helen Salyer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Along for the ride Mabel had taken her old friend the pistol.</p>
<p>In fairness, Mabel did, on the sidewalk in front of Helen Salyer&rsquo;s house, give George one last chance, asking him to come back to her.&nbsp; George approached and said, firmly, no.&nbsp; With that, Mabel shot him in the stomach; the force of the blast turned him around and Mabel shot him again in the back.&nbsp; Mabel walked back to her car, got in, and sat calmly there until authorities arrived. &nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="143" height="263" border="0" align="right" title="helen" alt="helen" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2264/2190610901_cef07b0c4a_o.jpg" />Mabel was arrested by Detective Lieutenants Brown and Adams of University Station, who found her composed, and that she could only comment that if she couldn&rsquo;t live with him, no-one could.&nbsp; When asked if she felt any regret, she replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is a woman ever really sorry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(With no defense offered other than the &ldquo;unwritten law,&rdquo; on May 19 she was ordered held to Superior Court for trial by Municipal Judge Rosencranz on charges of assault with intent to commit murder.&nbsp; She told the court &ldquo;I shot him because I loved him&rdquo; and reiterated &ldquo;sure I shot him&mdash;if I couldn&rsquo;t live with him I wasn&rsquo;t going let anyone else live with him.&rdquo;&nbsp; The jury, out an hour, gave her a full acquittal on May 24.)</p>
