<div>
<div align="left"><img loading="lazy" width="252" height="272" border="0" align="left" title="winniehoward" alt="winniehoward" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1362/1267306529_6b91927f9b_o.jpg" />Last week, we learned of a <a title="deadbaby" target="_blank" href="/?p=2085">baby found dead in a Main Street flophouse</a>, apparently strangled, with cotton stuffed in his nose and mouth.&nbsp; Police were looking for the woman who&#8217;d registered for the hotel room, a Mrs. W. Howard, who&#8217;d left the establishment the day before the infant&#8217;s body was discovered.&nbsp; Since then, things have gone from curious to curiouser.</p>
<p>Police found a bundle of little Norman Howard&#8217;s sleepers stashed in a downtown department store shortly after the body was found.&nbsp; Captain of Detectives Bean said, &quot;The mother is probably wandering around in a deranged condition and I believe she will either attempt to take her life or will put in an appearance at some institution within a few hours.&quot;</p>
<p>While they continued to search for Howard, police investigations uncovered some information about the missing mother and her recent activities.&nbsp; Winnie Howard, 35, and her husband, Frank, had purchased a chicken farm in Norco, but separated soon afterwards; Winnie left the farm when she could no longer make the payments.&nbsp; Since then, she&#8217;d been staying with her baby in hotels around Riverside and Corona, finally going to her twin sister Minnie&#8217;s home in Reseda.</p></div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">Minnie Fabbro said that Winnie had left a few days before the baby was killed, and that she&#8217;d experienced a psychic vision where she saw her sister&#8217;s body floating in the ocean the night before police came to question her.</p>
<p>After days of searching, Winnie Howard was finally found on the evening of August 26, not in the ocean, but at a Sierra Madre campground.&nbsp; She&#8217;d registered there under a false name, but had never claimed her campsite.&nbsp; Instead, Winnie had spent the four days since the death of her son wandering the hills without food or water.&nbsp; She was taken into custody, and placed under psychiatric watch.&nbsp; Upon hearing of Howard&#8217;s plight, a group of philanthropic club women took pity on her, and retained Attorney Milton Golden to defend her.</p>
<p>Today, homicide investigator Eddie King files an insanity complaint against Howard, and the District Attorney&#8217;s Office warned that if Howard was found sane, they would charge her with murder.&nbsp; Golden replied that, despite this, they would fight the insanity charge.&nbsp; He said, &quot;Mrs. Howard is not insane.&nbsp; She accidentally rolled over on the child in her sleep and caused its death.&nbsp; If the District Attorney&#8217;s office wants to file a murder complaint, we are ready to go to trial.&quot;</p>
<p>As far as the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> shows, it never came to that.&nbsp; On September 6, Howard was declared sane and sent to a sanatorium for two weeks to complete her recovery.&nbsp; Afterwards, she was released into Minnie&#8217;s custody.</div>

<div>August 23, 1927<br />Los Angeles </p>
<p>The news of the day is not especially happy. Film director <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0903049/" target="_blank">Josef Von Sternberg&#8217;</a>s marriage to assistant director/actress <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0747324/" target="_blank">Riza Royce</a> has ended after a year following an disagreement over Miss Royce&#8217;s determination to have a nose job. Miss Royce had her nose straightened and collected cash and a car, while Mr. Von Sternberg kept their <a href="https://www.zillow.com/HomeDetails.htm?zprop=20776175" target="_blank">home</a> at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=6252+Drexel,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=34.04458,-118.24896&#038;sspn=0.006863,0.012681&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.069743,-118.363008&#038;spn=0.006861,0.012681&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">6252 Drexel</a>.</p>
<p>The first anniversary of the death of screen sheik Rudolph Valentino was occasion for a Catholic mass at the Church of the Blessed Sacrament attended by family and a few friends and fans, in stark contrast to the mob scenes that accompanied his burial. Following the service, the worshippers visited <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&#038;GRid=1053" target="_blank">Valentino&#8217;s crypt</a> in the Hollywood Mausoleum and strewed flowers around the aisles.</p>
<p>And down at a flophouse at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=1104+South+Main+Street,+Los+Angeles,+CA&#038;sll=34.04458,-118.24896&#038;sspn=0.006863,0.012681&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.041761,-118.255055&#038;spn=0.006863,0.012681&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">1104 South Main Street</a>, after a day&#8217;s posting, the sign on a door warning the residents not to disturb the baby became an object of curiosity, and the door was opened. Inside, a tiny redheaded boy babe of perhaps 14 months, quite dead, with cotton stuffed in his mouth and nostrils, a bloody nightgown and signs of strangulation on the child&#8217;s neck. Police have taken fingerprints from the room and handwriting samples from the note and hotel register, and are searching for a Mrs. W. Howard of Los Angeles. The nameless infant now rests in the County Morgue.</div>
