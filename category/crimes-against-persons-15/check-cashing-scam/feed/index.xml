<p>April 6, 1927<br />Redlands&nbsp;</p>
<p>CONfidential to all garage managers: be on the lookout for a swell-looking swell of about 40 sporting diamonds on his fingers, checkered suit and a loud necktie, who pulls up in a swishy wagon spilling tales of his string of racehorses in TJ, the barn he&#8217;s rented for them in town and how he&#8217;ll be bringing the ponies up presently, and in the meanwhile, his car isn&#8217;t running great, so can he hire a car and chauffeur to drive him back to LA, and meanwhile, can you cash this $135 check? </p>
<p>When this charmer stopped by Charles Maynard&#8217;s Pioneer Tranfer Company garage, Maynard was dazzled by his line and said yes, yes, a thousand times yes. Now he&#8217;s got a stolen car on his lot, a bad check in his register and a cranky chauffeur who, after waiting four hours for his client outside a Los Angeles hotel, drove back to Redlands to tell Maynard just what a dope he&#8217;d been. All that glitters, etc.</p>
