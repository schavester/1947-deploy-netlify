<p>February 9, 1927<br />Los Angeles</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="258" height="209" border="0" align="left" title="deathdefyin" alt="deathdefyin" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2025/2250027066_fd18c59e1a_o.jpg" />Sure, while we&rsquo;ve <a title="sissies" target="_blank" href="https://www.47upgradepath7.richardschave.com//tags/stunt-driving">repeatedly</a> reported to you about blindfolded drivings&mdash;today was announced something that actually <em>guarantees</em> splintering wood and crunching metal. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Finley Henderson has a really good idea:&nbsp; dive an airplane from a height of 1,000 feet, clip the wings from the machine between two telegraph poles, and crash into a bungalow with the remains of his plane at sixty miles an hour.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry:&nbsp; he wears the shoulder and shin guards of the football field, the breast pad of the baseball umpire and a catcher&rsquo;s mask.&nbsp; Kids, try this at home.&nbsp; Above your home.&nbsp; <em>Into</em> your home.</p>
<p>Sponsored by Earl L. White and <a title="forallyourlisteningpleasure" target="_blank" href="https://www.radioheritage.net/Story36.asp">KELW</a>!&nbsp; Come on out to Burbank&rsquo;s <a title="MagnoliaPark" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burbank,_California#Magnolia_Park_Area">Magnolia Park</a> and watch the fun! </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="126" height="230" border="0" align="right" title="FearlessFinley" alt="FearlessFinley" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2161/2250087294_40d53d2b1b_o.jpg" />For the record, when the stunt was performed on February 20, Finley emerged unscathed, smoking a cigarette.&nbsp; And then noted for the wowed crowd and boys of the press &ldquo;The stunt is easy if you know how to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finley made the news again in June, when, at the Glendale Airport Air Rodeo, just as he was stepping into his plane (this time, to crash into a barn), in front of <em>all those eager spectators</em>, United States Deputy Marshal Charles F. &ldquo;Spoil Sport&rdquo; Walsh served Finley a summons.&nbsp; Hot on Walsh&#8217;s heels were pansy Capts. Walter F. Parkin and William B. Breingan, of the recently created Aeronautics Branch, United States Department of Commerce (oh, Mary), there to enforce their writ of injunction restraining Finley from performing the stunt.</p>
<p>Apparently, these hi-falutin&rsquo; aeronautics fellows have just made stunting within five miles of a regularly established and operated air line against the law&hellip;apparently also is flying a plane that is wholly unsafe, and is likely to collapse upon the audience when in flight.</p>
<p>But wasn&rsquo;t that part of the <a title="TGWP" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfZhXhCGwEA">thrill</a>?&nbsp; No wonder we went into a depression.</p>

<p>Thompson, 47 years of age though who reportedly looks 30, has made 332 <a title="eyelesssite" target="_blank" href="https://www.answers.com/topic/eyeless-sight">paroptic</a> public exhibhibitions, in every great city of America and Europe, and will make this, his Los Angeles trip, at one hundred miles, his last. </p>
<p>Thompson states that he has more competition here than anywhere else in the world.&nbsp; &ldquo;Driving around Los Angeles I find a good many blind drivers,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I even encountered one who was blind drunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On January 31st, his 333rd exhibition (spooky) Thompson was blindfolded by Deputy Chief of Police Spellman, and did indeed motor one hundred miles through the congested centers of Los Angeles, Hollywood and Pasadena, obeying all signals and laws, without a hitch.</p>
<p>And now he&rsquo;s ceased.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s had to stop because in having only two layers of skin (as opposed to the three you and I have), in conjunction with the fasting he must undergo to sharpen his dermoptic wits, has proven bad for his health. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In retirement, Thompson plans on devoting the rest of his life to hypnotizing people over the radio, via <a title="Mesmer" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Mesmer">Mesmer</a>&rsquo;s system of suggestion.</p>

<p>August 10, 1927<br />Los Angeles&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Hauser and Jefferson today, Vernadine Burke and Margaret Goesman, both 16, sank up to their ankles in the burning peat that was combusting merrily away beneath the surface. In trying to extricate themselves, the horrified girls also scorched their hands. They were treated at Receiving Hospital and released.</p>
<p>At the Biltmore, manager and VP James Woods was deftly fending off the insistent demands of Captain J.M. Burman, mariner, aviator and San Pedro resident, that the hotel back his scheme to fly from Japan to Los Angeles with his pet baboon as his co-pilot. Burman states he is ideally suited for such a flight because he knows all the Pacific mountain peaks by which he and his monkey pal would steer.</p>
<p>And in Venice, Mrs. Anna E. Van Skike was planning to celebrate her 67th birthday with a 25-mile swim from Point Dume back to her home shore, in recognition of the good health that regular swimming has brought her. Her doctors declared she had tuberculosis at 55 and would surely die, but swimming chased the lung blots away for the Oklahoma native. Hundreds turned out in 1924 to watch the lady dive off the Venice pier, swim ten miles along the shore and sing the &quot;Star Spangled Banner&quot; from the waves on her return.</p>
<p> This is Van Skike&#8217;s seventh birthday distance swim, and her longest, and will be done with the support, encouragement and liberal doses of hot coffee from lifeguards Slert and Kinney, who will row their boat in the wake of the olive oil-coated &quot;aged mermaid.&quot; She&#8217;ll begin the feat at 2am and hopes to be home in time for dinner, though she often quips she would &quot;rather swim than eat&quot; and avoids fried food and pastry for their waterlogging effects. She prefers the pre-dawn hours for her feats, as the water is calmer then, and she is subject to seasickness in heavy surf. She has founded a distance swimming club, and recommends the activity to all.</p>

<p>June 29, 1927<br />near Cordova, Alaska</p>
<p>Hollywood death came to the far north today, in the loss of stuntman Ray Thompson, 29, a player in a white water rapids stunt gone wrong on the roaring Copper River in remote Abercrombie Canyon. Thompson was on location for the new M-G-M picture <em>Trail of &#8217;98,</em> starring the fiery Dolores del Rio, under the direction of assistant director Harry Schenck. Numerous small boats were in the stream packed with stuntmen and cameramen shooting a thrilling scene of Gold Rush-era peril, when Thompson and F.H. Daughters of Spokane fell into the water. Joseph Bautin of Juneau jumped in to try to save the men, and joined them in death; his was the only body recovered. Also in the water that day, stunt man Gordon Craveth, who managed to swim to shore.</p>
<p><em>Motion Picture News</em> previewed the film and its innovative projection technique, but made no mention of the blood shed in its production: </p>
<p>&quot;A big picture, easily of roadshow size, and big because of spectacular sequences this is our opinion on The Trail of &#8217;98, directed by Clarence Brown for M-G-M. More pointedly, it is a presentation of the right sort, by which we mean that the presentation is the picture itself, through the &quot;Fantomscreen,&quot; of which more later.</p>
<p>As to the artistic greatness of <em>The Trail of &#8217;98</em>, we don&#8217;t know. Who does? But big at the box-office it will certainly be, unless we miss our guess.</p>
<p>The story is the Klondike Gold Rush, and is of epic dimensions. The cast- Dolores del Rio, Ralph Forbes, Tully Marshall, Karl Dane, Harry Carey, George Cooper, and others- is, excellent, with Carey in the forefront as to honors, and Dane and Cooper mostly carrying the</p>
<p>The frenzied rush to the Klondike from all corners of America, and what happened to the individual in his or her fight against the perils of the North, form the story background.</p>
<p>The handling of the characters in this screen version of the Robert W. Service story is dwarfed by the spectacular features. These are four in number: a breath-taking snowslide; the running of the rapids in frail boats; the Chilkoot Pass stuff, with big panorama shots; and the burning of Dawson City.</p>
<p>For the snowshoe sequence, the screen is suddenly enlarged to twice normal size, and moved down to the curtain-line. The effect is, of course, electrifying and carries a big punch. The same method is used with the running of the rapids, a remarkable spectacle. The &quot;Fantomscreen&quot; device, which moves the screen forward or back without interrupting the picture, is a great piece of show manship.</p>
<p>The picture will be roadshowed by J.J. McCarthy, who handled the six great roadshows of the industry&#8217;s history: <em>The Birth of A Nation, Way Down East, The Ten Commandments, The Covered Wagon, The Big Parade, Ben Hur.</em>&quot;</p>
