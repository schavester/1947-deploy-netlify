<p>February 9, 1927<br />Los Angeles</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="258" height="209" border="0" align="left" title="deathdefyin" alt="deathdefyin" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2025/2250027066_fd18c59e1a_o.jpg" />Sure, while we&rsquo;ve <a title="sissies" target="_blank" href="http://www.47upgradepath7.richardschave.com//tags/stunt-driving">repeatedly</a> reported to you about blindfolded drivings&mdash;today was announced something that actually <em>guarantees</em> splintering wood and crunching metal. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Finley Henderson has a really good idea:&nbsp; dive an airplane from a height of 1,000 feet, clip the wings from the machine between two telegraph poles, and crash into a bungalow with the remains of his plane at sixty miles an hour.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry:&nbsp; he wears the shoulder and shin guards of the football field, the breast pad of the baseball umpire and a catcher&rsquo;s mask.&nbsp; Kids, try this at home.&nbsp; Above your home.&nbsp; <em>Into</em> your home.</p>
<p>Sponsored by Earl L. White and <a title="forallyourlisteningpleasure" target="_blank" href="http://www.radioheritage.net/Story36.asp">KELW</a>!&nbsp; Come on out to Burbank&rsquo;s <a title="MagnoliaPark" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burbank,_California#Magnolia_Park_Area">Magnolia Park</a> and watch the fun! </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="126" height="230" border="0" align="right" title="FearlessFinley" alt="FearlessFinley" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2161/2250087294_40d53d2b1b_o.jpg" />For the record, when the stunt was performed on February 20, Finley emerged unscathed, smoking a cigarette.&nbsp; And then noted for the wowed crowd and boys of the press &ldquo;The stunt is easy if you know how to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finley made the news again in June, when, at the Glendale Airport Air Rodeo, just as he was stepping into his plane (this time, to crash into a barn), in front of <em>all those eager spectators</em>, United States Deputy Marshal Charles F. &ldquo;Spoil Sport&rdquo; Walsh served Finley a summons.&nbsp; Hot on Walsh&#8217;s heels were pansy Capts. Walter F. Parkin and William B. Breingan, of the recently created Aeronautics Branch, United States Department of Commerce (oh, Mary), there to enforce their writ of injunction restraining Finley from performing the stunt.</p>
<p>Apparently, these hi-falutin&rsquo; aeronautics fellows have just made stunting within five miles of a regularly established and operated air line against the law&hellip;apparently also is flying a plane that is wholly unsafe, and is likely to collapse upon the audience when in flight.</p>
<p>But wasn&rsquo;t that part of the <a title="TGWP" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfZhXhCGwEA">thrill</a>?&nbsp; No wonder we went into a depression.</p>

<div align="left">Today, women on the outskirts of town performed astounding acts of bravery, whether they were defending themselves, saving lives, or simply defying their mothers.</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">In Glendale, early this morning, Paul Courts broke into the home of Anna and Lucille Sousa at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=3050+menlo+street,+glendale,+ca&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=34.450489,59.765625&#038;layer=&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=16&#038;ll=34.193896,-118.226774&#038;spn=0.008786,0.014591&#038;om=1&#038;iwloc=addr" target="_blank">3050 Menlo Street</a>, and &quot;attempted to press his attentions&quot; on Lucille, 17.&nbsp; The girl seized a revolver and pointed it at him, at which point, Courts fled the Sousa home and was arrested for disturbing the peace.</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">150 miles away, the Deer Creek Cattlemen&#8217;s Association&#8217;s annual round-up and rodeo in <a href="http://www.ghosttowns.com/states/ca/whiteriver.htm" target="_blank">White River</a> was just another day at the fair until an unpiloted car began rolling down a steep hill towards a crowd of spectators below.&nbsp; Mrs. Burt Smith averted tragedy by jumping onto the car&#8217;s running board, steering it through several groups of children, and crashing it into the racetrack.&nbsp; Smith suffered a few bruises, the car, only a crushed radiator.</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left"><img loading="lazy" width="242" height="108" border="0" align="right" src="//farm1.static.flickr.com/220/471770670_01f6b75b2a_o.jpg" alt="burbankgirl" title="burbankgirl" />And back in the fair city of Burbank, 17-year-old Mignon Jones parachuted from a height of 2000 feet clad only in a sailor suit.&nbsp; Jones&#8217;s mother had discovered her daughter&#8217;s plan, and notified the police in the hopes of stopping her.&nbsp; However, by the time Burbank police officers arrived at the airport, Jones had already made a perfect landing and vacated the premises.&nbsp; She was later found at a local skating rink.</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">Little Mignon then faded from the pages of the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, which comes as something of a surprise.</div>

The massive trunk could not be circled by three men stretching their arms and touching their fingertipsÃ¢â‚¬â€hardly by four men.
