										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="body">
<div>
<div align="left"><img loading="lazy" width="252" height="272" border="0" align="left" title="winniehoward" alt="winniehoward" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1362/1267306529_6b91927f9b_o.jpg" />Last week, we learned of a <a title="deadbaby" target="_blank" href="https://1947project.com/?p=2085">baby found dead in a Main Street flophouse</a>, apparently strangled, with cotton stuffed in his nose and mouth.&nbsp; Police were looking for the woman who&#8217;d registered for the hotel room, a Mrs. W. Howard, who&#8217;d left the establishment the day before the infant&#8217;s body was discovered.&nbsp; Since then, things have gone from curious to curiouser.</p>
<p>Police found a bundle of little Norman Howard&#8217;s sleepers stashed in a downtown department store shortly after the body was found.&nbsp; Captain of Detectives Bean said, &quot;The mother is probably wandering around in a deranged condition and I believe she will either attempt to take her life or will put in an appearance at some institution within a few hours.&quot;</p>
<p>While they continued to search for Howard, police investigations uncovered some information about the missing mother and her recent activities.&nbsp; Winnie Howard, 35, and her husband, Frank, had purchased a chicken farm in Norco, but separated soon afterwards; Winnie left the farm when she could no longer make the payments.&nbsp; Since then, she&#8217;d been staying with her baby in hotels around Riverside and Corona, finally going to her twin sister Minnie&#8217;s home in Reseda.</p></div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">Minnie Fabbro said that Winnie had left a few days before the baby was killed, and that she&#8217;d experienced a psychic vision where she saw her sister&#8217;s body floating in the ocean the night before police came to question her.</p>
<p>After days of searching, Winnie Howard was finally found on the evening of August 26, not in the ocean, but at a Sierra Madre campground.&nbsp; She&#8217;d registered there under a false name, but had never claimed her campsite.&nbsp; Instead, Winnie had spent the four days since the death of her son wandering the hills without food or water.&nbsp; She was taken into custody, and placed under psychiatric watch.&nbsp; Upon hearing of Howard&#8217;s plight, a group of philanthropic club women took pity on her, and retained Attorney Milton Golden to defend her.</p>
<p>Today, homicide investigator Eddie King files an insanity complaint against Howard, and the District Attorney&#8217;s Office warned that if Howard was found sane, they would charge her with murder.&nbsp; Golden replied that, despite this, they would fight the insanity charge.&nbsp; He said, &quot;Mrs. Howard is not insane.&nbsp; She accidentally rolled over on the child in her sleep and caused its death.&nbsp; If the District Attorney&#8217;s office wants to file a murder complaint, we are ready to go to trial.&quot;</p>
<p>As far as the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> shows, it never came to that.&nbsp; On September 6, Howard was declared sane and sent to a sanatorium for two weeks to complete her recovery.&nbsp; Afterwards, she was released into Minnie&#8217;s custody.</div>

<p class="MsoNormal">Because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s celebrating its centennial this month, I paid a visit to Sierra Madre and while savoring a cinnamon dolce latte at the local Starbucks, watched the sun set on a historic Union 76 ball. A perfect fusion of two projects.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">And hereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Sierra MadreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Old North Church, with the artillery piece in the park across the street. Note the problem I encountered with lighting. Architectural photography is surely not my forte. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now for the business at hand. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve often thought that with a century of lawmaking under its belt, the state Legislature might want to take the afternoon off. After all, with more than a century of making laws, whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s left to regulate? </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Times provides a tidy answer to my question. Here&#8217;s what the Legislature was wrestling with 100 years ago:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-family:Symbol;">Ã‚Â·<span style="">        </span></span><!--[endif]-->The Senate unanimously passes a ban on docking horsesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ tails and prohibits anyone from bringing horses with docked tails into the state. Those who own horses with docked tails would have to register them with the local county officials. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-family:Symbol;">Ã‚Â·<span style="">        </span></span><!--[endif]-->A committee urges the Senate to pass Sen. BlackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tax exemption bill for all the buildings at Stanford as well as the bonds the university holds in trust. </p>

Sanford introduces a bill seeking to restrict corporate donations to political campaigns. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m so glad the Senate wrapped that up 100 years ago so it can get on to more pressing matters. </p>
