<p>Between Christ&rsquo;s wanderings in the deserts of Jericho, and Kidder&rsquo;s huddlings in the gardens of Glendale, there was Robert Sankey. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Sankey, 44, a prominent Riverside contractor, was in a splendid mood September seventh last; he had no domestic or financial troubles, and bid his lovely wife and 13 year-old daughter goodbye that morning in his home at <a title="houseofsankey" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=270+Bandini+Avenue,+Riverside,+California&#038;sll=33.969986,-117.392092&#038;sspn=0.016016,0.029182&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=33.972122,-117.392092&#038;spn=0.032031,0.058365&#038;z=14&#038;iwloc=cent&#038;om=1">270 Bandini Avenue</a> before a trip to Laguna Beach.&nbsp; He made it to Laguna Beach, and picked up $12,000 ($132,359 USD2006) in cash which he had been paid by the Colton School Board for the construction of Colton High School.</p>
<p>Sankey then told friends he was going for a swim, and left his bag, clothing, glasses and&nbsp; shoes at a hotel near the beach.&nbsp; From there he disappeared&hellip;the sea was dragged repeatedly for his body, but to no avail.&nbsp; Had the briny deep swallowed Sankey?&nbsp; And what became of the <em>money</em>?&nbsp; And what&rsquo;s this?&mdash;a few days ago, some Sankey acquaintance came forth and reported having seen Sankey on a Seattle-bound boat a day or two after the disappearance.</p>
<p>Today, Mrs. Paul McKenzie peered nervously through the window of her home at <a title="sankeyssis" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=4010+E+Massachusetts+St,+Long+Beach,+Los+Angeles,+California+90814,+United+States&#038;sll=33.972122,-117.392092&#038;sspn=0.032031,0.058365&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;cd=1&#038;geocode=0,33.768953,-118.145514&#038;ll=33.76973,-118.145514&#038;spn=0.008027,0.014591&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1">4010 Massachusetts, Long Beach</a>.&nbsp; There was a dazed, raggedy man wandering aimlessly up and down in front of her house for the better part of two hours.&nbsp; When she got up the nerve to confront the torn and tattered stranger, all a-jibber-jabberin&#8217; to himself, it was, you guessed it, her brother, Robert Sankey.&nbsp; Oh no, he insisted, <em>I&rsquo;m Andrew Borg</em>.</p>
<p>Well, the Borg, I mean Sankey, had only $500 left (in checks issued by a Seattle bank) of the twelve grand, and even less of an idea as to where he&rsquo;d been or what he&rsquo;d done.&nbsp; He could only confirm that his clothes had been given to him by &ldquo;the skipper,&rdquo; and that he&rsquo;d been to sea in a small boat with two men and a woman.</p>
<p>Further investigation revealed that Sankey recently boarded the steamer <a title="theevanger" target="_blank" href="https://content.lib.washington.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/imlsmaritime&#038;CISOPTR=324&#038;REC=6">Evanger</a> at San Francisco (booking passage to Buenos Aires as &ldquo;Andrew Borg, grain dealer, Witchita, Kan.&rdquo;), but put ashore at San Pedro the day he reappeared in Long Beach.</p>
<p>Sankey remains in his Borgian state at Seaside hospital, where Riverside county authorities are vexed with Seaside staff; the Sheriff is itching to serve two warrants on Sankey, each charging sixteen counts of violating the State wage law, but the pesky physicians demand that officers wait &lsquo;til Sankey&rsquo;s physical condition permits such activity.</p>
<p>Whether amnesia or grift, please bear in mind&hellip;steer clear of small boats, and beware &quot;the skipper.&quot;</p>

<p>Dear Mr. President,</p>
<p>Have observed the pleasure you are taking in fishing during your vacation this summer.&nbsp; We think you may be interested in a special lure, used with much success in California to tempt the speckled beauties which abound in the streams near your summer home.&nbsp; We are sending under separate cover a few of our best &quot;California squirrel tail bait.&quot;&nbsp; These were specially made for you and we trust they will bring you much luck.&nbsp; Squirrels are an agricultural pest in California, but we do find some use for a part of their anatomy.&nbsp; Trusting you will accept this contribution to your pleasure in the same spirit here manifested, we are:</p>
<p>Yours very truly,</p>
<p>L.J. Tobias, Chief Deputy Sheriff<br />George Bottel, Horticultural Inspector</div>

<p>Seems the Clarks got a few in &lsquo;em and, sans hollow leg and all, the booze went to their collective head, and they thought it a good idea to hop in a flivver and go tearing down <a title="missionblvdriverside" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=Mission+Boulevard,+Riverside,+Calif&#038;sll=34.032034,-118.469524&#038;sspn=0.015613,0.027809&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.025917,-117.448311&#038;spn=0.124913,0.222473&#038;z=12&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1">Mission Boulevard</a> here in Riverside.&nbsp; Despite the symbiosis that stems from years of wedded camaraderie, his stomping the gas while she pounded brake and clutch didn&rsquo;t work out to their combined advantage&#8230;no, these tourists from the Lone Star state plowed into another vehicle driven by one Fred Stutzman of West Riverside.</p>
<p>Deputy Sheriff Scott hauled the intoxicated unipeds off to the hoosegow, and reported that while both autos were severely damaged, no-one was seriously injured.&nbsp; Scott certainly realized that had someone involved lost a limb, he would have had to fill out the separate irony paperwork, instead of just checking the irony box on his standard report form.</p>

Riverside</p>
<p>Jesus Chavez was traveling from his home in El Monte to Colton, where he intended to celebrate Cinco de Mayo.  During the trip Chavez was under the intoxicating influence of liquor continuously, and for reasons unknown shot and killed one Veranze Mansibai on a lonely road near West Riverside.  </p>
<p>Chavez went into hiding, but Sheriff Wilson and Under Sheriff Evans eventually encountered his spring wagon.  A little further on they found the white and bay horses he was driving.  And a little after that, the tiny cabin in which Chavez was tightly holed up, continuing his alcoholiday.</p>
<p>There is little hope Chavez will be able to answer to the charges before the effects of his spree wear off.
