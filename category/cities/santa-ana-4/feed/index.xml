<p>In March of 1926 Alice&#8217;s husband M. J. Hanmore, a Fullerton oil worker, began experiencing stomach pains and loss of appetite; Drs. Claude E. Steen, Emerald J. Steen and John A. Whalen of the CME/<a title="WMH" target="_blank" href="https://www.whitememorial.com/content/about/history/index.asp">White Memorial Hospital</a> decided that an intensive course of that ever-beneficial ionizing radiation would do the trick.&nbsp; Today, Alice is charging in court that &ldquo;negligent and unskillful&rdquo; employment of X-rays resulted in severe fatal burns&mdash;she&rsquo;s asking for $30,000 ($348,669 USD2007).</p>
<p>(Our evangelical docs Steen &amp; Steen will make the papers again in March, charged of malpractice by one Mary A. Greene of Fullerton&mdash;she goes in for an ingrown toenail, so they take that portion of the nail.&nbsp; So far so good.&nbsp; Steen &amp; Steen subsequently amputate her big toe.&nbsp; <em>Then</em> they amputate much of her leg.&nbsp; Further operations result in anthropy of Mary&#8217;s thigh muscles.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll ask for $25,000.)</p>

<p>Those of you who have taken a club to an elderly woman know, that&rsquo;s six months in County.&nbsp; Everybody knows that.&nbsp; And just as those of us who have wielded a pool cue at a mother-in-law are looking at the ol&rsquo; six mos and that $500 ($5,515 USD2007) fine, that&#8217;s what shoulda faced Anaheim&rsquo;s Walter J. Jewell&mdash;except in his case there were <em>extenuating circumstances</em>.</p>
<p>You see, he&rsquo;s a man who loves his children.&nbsp; He <em>wuvs</em> them.&nbsp; In that bloodlusty kinda way.</p>
<p>Seems that Jewell arrived at wifey&rsquo;s house (they&rsquo;re separated) to pick up the kids for the customary week-end visit.&nbsp; But despite his being a prominent citizen, he just doesn&rsquo;t see fit to pay his alimony, which sent wifey&rsquo;s mother&mdash;the aforementioned mother-in-law&mdash;into a huff.&nbsp; Crone in question, Mrs. Marion Blake, also of Anaheim, refused to allow Jewell possession of the youngsters.&nbsp; Enraged, Jewell rushed back to his auto and retrieved his trusty billiard cue.&nbsp; Back in the house he did, though, stop short at cracking her skull open like a soft-boiled egg. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The court informed Mrs. Blake that it was &ldquo;inadvisable&rdquo; to take the law into her own hands&mdash;that would be apparent.&nbsp; Mr. Jewell was scolded that he was &ldquo;old enough to know better&rdquo; than to &ldquo;assault an aged woman with a club.&rdquo;&nbsp; That may be.&nbsp; In any event, because everyone loves children so durn much, Judge Ames decided to knock Jewell&rsquo;s punishment down to ninety days and nix the fine.&nbsp; Awwwww.</p>

<p>One Thomas Little was attempting to <a title="avoraid!" target="_blank" href="/?p=1940">raid</a> the fabled <a href="https://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt0b69p2j1/?layout=metadata&#038;brand=oac" target="_blank" title="utt">Utt</a> <a title="avocado" target="_blank" href="https://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:bV6vP9BardEJ:www.avocadosource.com/CAS_Yearbooks/CAS_16_1931/CAS_1931_PG_207-210.pdf+%22lemon+heights%22+utt+avocado&#038;hl=en&#038;ct=clnk&#038;cd=1&#038;gl=us&#038;client=firefox-a">avocado</a> groves down in <a title="lemonheights" target="_blank" href="https://www.latimes.com/classified/realestate/printedition/la-re-guide29may29,0,3788850.story?coll=la-class-realestate">Lemon Heights</a> when he ran afoul of &lsquo;cado guard George Henning.&nbsp; The two struggled for possession of a revolver while the two careened down a hillside in Litttle&#8217;s truck before Little was at last apprehended.</p>
<p>But, with Little having stolen nothing, how could it be proved that the value of what he intended to steal was more than $200?&nbsp; It was therefore up to Justice Morrison to determine the value of the accused man&rsquo;s intended grand larcency haul.&nbsp; Dep. Dist.-Atty. Collins produced the fifteen empty sacks that Mr. Little had in tow; the court estimated these sacks would likely hold fifteen hundred pounds of the bewitching fruit, and further determined that these be worth more than the lowest grand larceny charge of $200.</p>
<p>All that notwithstanding, it was declared at the hearing that Little came quite close to being caught in a bear trap.</p>

Los Angeles</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A quick trip to the Thomas Bros. will show that Los Angeles County doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t look like this, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not for lack of trying. The wealthy men of Los Angeles and Orange counties are furious with one another over an attempt by Assemblyman Phil Stanton to give Los Angeles County a strip of coastal communities as far south as Newport Beach.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The arguments in favor are simple: Los Angeles County money built those communities and Orange County is, at least as far as the Angelenos are concerned, poorly run. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Orange County faction accuses its northern neighbors of a land grab and notes the distance people would have to travel to serve on juries, for example. The Orange County businessmen say wealthy Los Angeles members of the Bolsa Chica Gun Club are seeking revenge after losing a lawsuit in Santa Ana against local peat farmers who were hunting ducks in the area. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Bonus fact: The Times says that Los Angeles has abandoned its efforts to annex San Pedro. (For now, anyway).</p>
