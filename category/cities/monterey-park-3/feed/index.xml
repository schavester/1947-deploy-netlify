F. Guaiano today on charges of stealing chickens.&nbsp; It seems last night officer T. J. Neal discovered the gentlemen in an automobile in the hills south of Monterey Park, along with empty sacks with feathers stuck to them, and a headless chicken.</p>
<p>The defendants pleaded not guilty, and to explain the presence of the chicken-in-question, one testified:&nbsp; &ldquo;The chicken was hopping along the road with its head off and jumped into our car.&rdquo;&nbsp; The others corroborated his statement.</p>
<p>The judge thought it was a good story, but not quite good enough to keep the trio out of jail for ten days.</p>

<p>June 25, 1927<br />Monterey Park</p>
<p>The latest version of the old riddle, <a title="Chicken Crosses Road" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_did_the_chicken_cross_the_road?" target="_blank">&ldquo;Why did the chicken cross the road&rdquo;</a>, debuted today in Judge P.F. Guaiano&rsquo;s courtroom. It fell flat. </p>
<p>While cruising his regular beat in the hills south of <a title="Monterey Park" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=monterey+park,+ca&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=13&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">Monterey Park</a>, Officer T.J. Neal eyeballed&nbsp;some shady looking characters in an automobile. The lawman resolved to have a look, and after further investigation he discovered three men, a decapitated chicken and three empty sacks with feathers stuck to them.&nbsp; Arriving at the obvious conclusion that the poultry had been pinched, Neal demanded an explanation for the beheaded bird. The suspects related a story so improbable it left the cop scratching his head in disbelief. </p>
<p>According to the men, Yeacio Tavary of <a title="Downey" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=downey,+ca&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=12&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">Downey</a>, Isa Magana of <a title="Belvedere Gardens" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=belvedere+park+los+angeles&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677071&#038;sspn=34.587666,86.396484&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.039165,-118.161864&#038;spn=0.008837,0.021093&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">Belvedere</a>, and Daniel Garcia of <a title="Los Angeles" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=los+angeles,+ca&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=9&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">Los Angeles</a>, they had been out for a drive when they spied a headless chicken running amok through the countryside. Imagine their surprise when, without warning, the frenzied fowl dashed up to their car and jumped in!</p>
<p>What were they to do? The bird possessed no identification, which ruled out returning it to its rightful owner. After a brief confab, the trio had decided to keep the bird and had been on their way to cook the obliging entree when they were rousted.</p>
<p>Officer Neal hadn&rsquo;t believed the fantastic tale of the hitchhiking chicken, and apparently neither had Judge Guaiano who mused &ldquo;Chickens are not that foolish&rdquo;, and ordered the defendants to spend ten days in the slammer.</p>

<p>If there&#8217;s one thing we at 1947project love even more than uncovering<br />  evidence of an incredibly weird forgotten crime, it&#8217;s Chinese<br />  food&#8211;especially dumplings! Whether fried or boiled, stuffed with<br />  shrimp, pork, pumpkin, fish, scallions or sometimes a little dollop of<br />  soup, nothing is more comforting and delicious.</p>
<p>  With <strong>Blood &amp; Dumplings</strong>, we&#8217;re combining our favorite things to bring<br />  you the first new Crime Bus tour of 2007, a a grim and gleeful descent<br />  into the criminal history of the San Gabriel Valley, including the battling Nazis of El Monte, the chilling (and probably incestuous) Case of the Buried Bride, missing Salvador Dali paintings, the dark history of the Lions Club&#8217;s lion meat BBQs held in eye- and nose-range of hundreds of the lovely beasts, the Man from Mars Bandit (his mystery revealed!), plus Phil Spector, neglected Manson victim Steve Parent, Geneva Ellroy and a peculiar East L.A. link to the JFK assassination, concealed Black Panthers and the coolest trailer parks in the Southland.</p>
<p>Included in the $55 ticket price is a special stop for Chinese comfort food at one of the best dumpling joints in Monterey Park&nbsp; and an afternoon picnic surrounded by real sea monsters.</p>
<p>  Click <a href="http://crimebus.dumplingjoint.com/" target="_blank">here</a> to buy your ticket by paypal, or <a href="http://www.47upgradepath7.richardschave.com//feedback" target="_self">email</a> to reserve a seat that you will purchase with a money order or check.</p>
<p>We hope to see YOU on the Crime Bus!</p>
<p>your hosts,<br />Kim Cooper &amp; Richard Schave </p>
