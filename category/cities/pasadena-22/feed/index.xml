<p>Seriously.&nbsp; George Shimanouchi was minding his own business in the garage of his home at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=126+W+Del+Mar+Blvd,+Pasadena,+Los+Angeles,+California+91105,+United+States&#038;sll=34.04377,-118.253639&#038;sspn=0.008197,0.014591&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;cd=2&#038;mpnum=0&#038;ll=34.141433,-118.152852&#038;spn=0.008187,0.014591&#038;z=16&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="georgeshouse">126 Elevado Drive </a>(now Del Mar) when the aforementioned giant negro (hey, not my nomenclature) arrived unbidden and hung the boy upside-down from a rafter. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A Mrs. C. Duncan, 105 Elevado, heard someone yelling for help across the street and called it in; either she took her own sweet time about it or the authorities did, because when Detective Seargeants Mansell and Cheek arrived, Shimanouchi, now semiconscious, had been suspended head-down for nearly an hour. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The boy held the opinion that his assailant planned to rob the house after tying him to the rafter, but officers found no evidence of entry.</p>
<p>(While Hippocrates was a firm believer in inversion therapy, practitioners evidently went to absurd lengths in sharing their craft before its popularization via <em>American Gigolo</em>.)</p>

<div>March 24, 1927<br />Los Angeles<br /><img loading="lazy" width="268" height="297" border="0" align="right" title="babyfarm" alt="babyfarm" src="//farm1.static.flickr.com/177/433082798_c1ba347c8e_o.gif" /><br />Investigators from the State Board of Pharmacy began traversing the city today, in search of physicians who illegally supplied narcotizing agents to Miss Minnie Hines.&nbsp; It seems that while under the spell of narcotics, Miss Hines develops a &ldquo;maternity complex&rdquo; which requires the purchase of infants.&nbsp; When her mind clears some days later, it then becomes necessary to farm them out again.&nbsp; Adding complexity to the case is the fact that due to her dope-addled brain, she rarely recollects the homes where she obtained or disposed of the babies.&nbsp; She is currently under Narcosan treatment for her affliction.</p>
<p>Ms. Hines was arrested March 9th when she attempted to buy a baby at Pasadena hospital, and attempted to escape by putting pillows under her clothes and pretending she was an expectant mother.&nbsp; Hines, 26, of Long Beach, has farmed out three of her own children (ages eighteen months to twelve years) and an estimated ten others.&nbsp; Babies, incidentally, generally run between sixty and one hundred dollars ($700-$1,169 USD 2007).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="295" height="287" border="0" align="left" title="litachaplin" alt="litachaplin" src="//farm1.static.flickr.com/165/433091894_89daa1dbc1_o.gif" />In other baby news:&nbsp; local actress Lita Grey Chaplin today dropped her renewed bid for temporary alimony for herself and her two toddlers in an attempt to force her husband, one Charles Chaplin, into court.&nbsp; (Mr. Chaplin had impregnated Lita Grey when she was 16, he 35, resulting in a marriage and sensationally scandalous divorce which, when finalized in August of 1927, cost Chaplin $825,000 [$9,648,650 USD 2007].)</p>
<p>According to Charlie&rsquo;s biographer Joyce Milton, the 1924 marriage was the inspiration of Nabokov&rsquo;s <em>Lolita</em>.</p>

<div>Yesterday&#8217;s Pasadena Confidential Crime Bus Tour was a hoot, as we glided around the Crown City in our air conditioned murder bus with a happy coterie of grisly lookyloos. Here are a few photos snapped along the way&#8230; </p>
<p> Below, Crimebo honors the lucky Miss Cathy with a pre-birthday litany of all the horrors that happened on the day she was born.</p>

<p>Here, Crimebo and hosts Kim and Nathan take a mid-tour breather at Connal&#8217;s on Washington Boulevard, conveniently loated between the sites of a hammer murder and a bathtub suicide. Plus their malts is yummy!</p>

<p>About the tour: By popular demand, and following many nights terrifying ourselves reading grisly old news reports until falling into fitfull sleep, our <strong>Pasadena Confidential </strong>crime bus tour rolls on Sunday, August 6, from 10am-3pm. This five-hour luxury coach tour offers surprising insights into the often weird and horrible history of the Crown City, from the infamous to the forgotten. Tickets are $47 per person, and include cookies and home-made lemonade. </p>
<p>From celebrated cases like the RFK assassination (with a visit to Sirhan Sirhan&#8217;s folks&#8217; house), &quot;Eraserhead&quot; star Jack Nance&#8217;s strange end, black magician/rocket scientist Jack Parsons&#8217; death-by-misadventure and the 1926 Rose Parade grand stand collapse, to fascinating obscurities, the tour&#8217;s dozens of murders, arsons, kidnappings, robberies, suicides, auto wrecks and oddball happening sites provide a alternate history of Pasadena that&#8217;s as fascinating as it is creepy.</p>
<p> Crime Bus passengers will tour the old Millionaire&#8217;s Row on Orange Grove, thrill to the shocking Sphinx Murder on the steps of the downtown Masonic Hall, wonder about the unknown fiend who sneaked past a little girl to poison her father&#8217;s beer, discover why people named Judd should think twice before moving to Pasadena, and explore the racist spirit of the early 20th century through two forgotten stories: that of a Chinaman with leprosy whose suicide by hanging was treated as a novel entertainment by hundreds of citizens, and the case of wealthy mulatto Archie Hill, who shot a white trolley ticket-taker dead for shortchanging him.  </p>
<p>For more about this tour, see Patricia Jiayi Ho&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pasadenastarnews.com/news/ci_4085286">feature</a> in the Pasadena Star-News.
