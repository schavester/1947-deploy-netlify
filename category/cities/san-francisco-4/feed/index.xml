<p>Between Christ&rsquo;s wanderings in the deserts of Jericho, and Kidder&rsquo;s huddlings in the gardens of Glendale, there was Robert Sankey. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Sankey, 44, a prominent Riverside contractor, was in a splendid mood September seventh last; he had no domestic or financial troubles, and bid his lovely wife and 13 year-old daughter goodbye that morning in his home at <a title="houseofsankey" target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=270+Bandini+Avenue,+Riverside,+California&#038;sll=33.969986,-117.392092&#038;sspn=0.016016,0.029182&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=33.972122,-117.392092&#038;spn=0.032031,0.058365&#038;z=14&#038;iwloc=cent&#038;om=1">270 Bandini Avenue</a> before a trip to Laguna Beach.&nbsp; He made it to Laguna Beach, and picked up $12,000 ($132,359 USD2006) in cash which he had been paid by the Colton School Board for the construction of Colton High School.</p>
<p>Sankey then told friends he was going for a swim, and left his bag, clothing, glasses and&nbsp; shoes at a hotel near the beach.&nbsp; From there he disappeared&hellip;the sea was dragged repeatedly for his body, but to no avail.&nbsp; Had the briny deep swallowed Sankey?&nbsp; And what became of the <em>money</em>?&nbsp; And what&rsquo;s this?&mdash;a few days ago, some Sankey acquaintance came forth and reported having seen Sankey on a Seattle-bound boat a day or two after the disappearance.</p>
<p>Today, Mrs. Paul McKenzie peered nervously through the window of her home at <a title="sankeyssis" target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=4010+E+Massachusetts+St,+Long+Beach,+Los+Angeles,+California+90814,+United+States&#038;sll=33.972122,-117.392092&#038;sspn=0.032031,0.058365&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;cd=1&#038;geocode=0,33.768953,-118.145514&#038;ll=33.76973,-118.145514&#038;spn=0.008027,0.014591&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1">4010 Massachusetts, Long Beach</a>.&nbsp; There was a dazed, raggedy man wandering aimlessly up and down in front of her house for the better part of two hours.&nbsp; When she got up the nerve to confront the torn and tattered stranger, all a-jibber-jabberin&#8217; to himself, it was, you guessed it, her brother, Robert Sankey.&nbsp; Oh no, he insisted, <em>I&rsquo;m Andrew Borg</em>.</p>
<p>Well, the Borg, I mean Sankey, had only $500 left (in checks issued by a Seattle bank) of the twelve grand, and even less of an idea as to where he&rsquo;d been or what he&rsquo;d done.&nbsp; He could only confirm that his clothes had been given to him by &ldquo;the skipper,&rdquo; and that he&rsquo;d been to sea in a small boat with two men and a woman.</p>
<p>Further investigation revealed that Sankey recently boarded the steamer <a title="theevanger" target="_blank" href="http://content.lib.washington.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/imlsmaritime&#038;CISOPTR=324&#038;REC=6">Evanger</a> at San Francisco (booking passage to Buenos Aires as &ldquo;Andrew Borg, grain dealer, Witchita, Kan.&rdquo;), but put ashore at San Pedro the day he reappeared in Long Beach.</p>
<p>Sankey remains in his Borgian state at Seaside hospital, where Riverside county authorities are vexed with Seaside staff; the Sheriff is itching to serve two warrants on Sankey, each charging sixteen counts of violating the State wage law, but the pesky physicians demand that officers wait &lsquo;til Sankey&rsquo;s physical condition permits such activity.</p>
<p>Whether amnesia or grift, please bear in mind&hellip;steer clear of small boats, and beware &quot;the skipper.&quot;</p>

<p>April 27, 1927<br />Los Angeles</p>
<p>Sim Cross is alive, ALIVE! The Los Angeles man, resident of 4195 Third Avenue, was believed a suicide by pals after a full suit of clothes but the underpants were found on the beach at Redondo on April 19. Mugs were raised, his good and bad points debated, and perhaps the pals even parcelled out his nicest ties among them. But on the 21st there came a telegram, signed Sim and sent from San Francisco, announcing that reports of his demise were not to be believed. </p>
<p>In time, he returned home, bearing a singularly peculiar tale. The last thing he remembered, see, he was fighting a riptide. And then, inky darkness. He came to 48 hours later in an SF hotel room, with bruised feet and no idea how he got there. In the room, clothes and a suitcase he&#8217;d never seen before. He dressed, and stepped into the street, where two men accosted him. It was thanks to them, they said, that Sim was in this spot. And now all they needed was for him to take someone&#8217;s place in a hospital for a few more days and&#8230;</p>
<p>Here Sim drew the curtain over one of the most perfect descriptions of cliche detective&#8217;s peril as we&#8217;ve ever read. He claims that he simply demured and came home.</p>
<p>Was it all fantasy? Or did once there dwell strangely maleable hoodlums, who would conk a guy while he swam and spirit him away to play a part in a bandage opera, then let him go when he said he wasn&#8217;t in the mood? We&#8217;ll never know, for after this one extraordinary incident, Sim Cross vanished from the record, but never from our hearts. </p>
