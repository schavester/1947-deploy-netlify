<p>That Ernest M. Branson just couldn&rsquo;t leave well enough alone.&nbsp; He was a member in good standing of <a href="https://www.iww.org/unions/iu510/sanpedro/ip1924.shtml" target="_blank" title="pedroklan">San Pedro</a> 51, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, and all was fine and hunky-dory, until he started stirring the pot with his <em>talk</em>.&nbsp; So from under the sheet came a big boot, and out went Ernest; now, Ernest says he was libeled in the written order that banished him from the Kluxers.</p>
<p>What was it ever did Ernest <em>say</em>?&nbsp; To hell with the flag?&nbsp; Hooray for Hebrews?&nbsp; Eucharist is yummy?&nbsp; Thomas Jefferson got it on with Sally Hemmings?</p>
<p>No, all he did was stir up some internal dissension inside the Klan, which resulted in his ouster (maybe he sided with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madge_Oberholtzer" target="_blank" title="oberholtzer">Madge over DC</a>.)&nbsp; That&rsquo;s gotta be the worst libel of all&mdash;accused of making mishegas in the klavern!</p>
<p>So now Ernest has filed a $25,000 ($275,749 USD2006) libel suit against none other than Exalted Cyclops Karl K. Keller. &nbsp;</p>
<p>(Yes, Karl K. Keller.&nbsp; I bet his real name was Herman Flork.)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A quick trip to the Thomas Bros. will show that Los Angeles County doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t look like this, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not for lack of trying. The wealthy men of Los Angeles and Orange counties are furious with one another over an attempt by Assemblyman Phil Stanton to give Los Angeles County a strip of coastal communities as far south as Newport Beach.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The arguments in favor are simple: Los Angeles County money built those communities and Orange County is, at least as far as the Angelenos are concerned, poorly run. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Orange County faction accuses its northern neighbors of a land grab and notes the distance people would have to travel to serve on juries, for example. The Orange County businessmen say wealthy Los Angeles members of the Bolsa Chica Gun Club are seeking revenge after losing a lawsuit in Santa Ana against local peat farmers who were hunting ducks in the area. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Bonus fact: The Times says that Los Angeles has abandoned its efforts to annex San Pedro. (For now, anyway).</p>

<p>Remember these men when next you enjoy the fruits of our port system.</p>

San Pedro</p>
<p>When poolhall manager G.M. Woodward&#8217;s rented house on 17th Street burned on June 29, landlord Mrs. M. Sweetman was grateful no one was killed. But after discovering the fire was intentionally set by Woodward, who had hopes of claiming $1100 insurance on his furnishings, she is fuming herself. Woodward is in County Jail, unable to make his bail.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, passengers on the North German Lloyd liner <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_liner_Kronprinz_Wilhelm" target="_blank">Kronprinz Wilhelm</a> arrived in Hoboken with a terrifying tale of their <a href="https://www.maritimequest.com/liners/kronprinz_wilhelm_1901/kronprinz_wilhelm_data.htm" target="_blank">ship</a> having struck an iceberg in the North Atlantic on July 8. Authoress <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gertrude_Atherton" target="_blank">Gertrude Atherton</a> and statesman Baron Speck Von Sternberg were among the shaken travellers.</p>

San Pedro</p>
<p>The British bark Falls of Gary arrived in San Pedro tonight, 144 days from Antwerp, journeying around the Horn to bring a load of cement to Los Angeles.  An uneventful journey, except that they arrived one man short.  James Milligan, cook and steward, had been drinking heavily before the vessel set off.  At one day out he was put to bed by shipmates and when sought again, had vanished.  The disappearance is being considered a suicide.</p>
<p>Not a shocking story in and of itself&#8211;but one must wonder:  cement?  Had Los Angeles not evolved to the point of discovering the wonders of water mixed with gypsum?  Granted, I love Hassids and Quentin Metsys and Belgian chocolate, but what makes Flemish cement so precious that it must be imported here on three-masted vessels flying the flag of Edward VII?
