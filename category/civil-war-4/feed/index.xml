<p>Frank E. Foster once stared down the blazing Enfields and Richmonds of Johnny Reb, Bragg&rsquo;s cannons and Forrest&rsquo;s cavalry, but it took some punk kid from Long Beach to put him down for good.&nbsp; </p>
<p>That punk kid is Richard Robert Haver, 16, whose penchant for driving other people&rsquo;s cars landed him in Chino, where police interviewed him today about a spate of Long Beach robberies last September.&nbsp; Sure, during <a title="320" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=320+N+Colorado+Pl,+Long+Beach,+CA+90814&#038;sll=33.769569,-118.159547&#038;sspn=0.00874,0.014591&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=33.769569,-118.159547&#038;spn=0.00874,0.014591&#038;t=k&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1">one robbery</a> he pushed an old man.&nbsp; Haver hasn&rsquo;t been told that the old man <em>died</em>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw him coming, although it was dark,&rdquo; Haver told Detective Sergeants Smith and Alyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;At first I tried to avoid him by slinking back against the wall, hoping the man wouldn&rsquo;t see me.&nbsp; But he grabbed me by the coat with both hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Apparently the 85 y.o. Foster figured the whippersnapper wouldn&rsquo;t be reconstructed.)&nbsp; &ldquo;I kept pushing him into the screen porch where he slept.&nbsp; The door was open as I rushed for it and I pushed the man out of the way.&nbsp; He tripped on the steps and fell outdoors onto the sidewalk.&nbsp; Then I ran toward the front of the house and headed for the ocean.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry I pushed him so hard, now that I know he is an old man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Haver&rsquo;ll be sorrier once the authorities inform him that, on top of being popped for the eight homes he ransacked while the occupants slept (earning him the sobriquet &quot;The Pants Burglar&quot;, in that he stole away with trousers in the night and emptied their pockets), he&rsquo;s a murderer.</p>
<p>(Haver was sent to the State Reform School to remain until he turned 21, at which point the courts would again pass upon his case; the papers make no mention of that event or its outcome.)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="203" height="130" border="0" align="right" title="quails!" alt="quails!" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2223/2057794267_eccd75bf3e_o.gif" />In further news of the Boys in Blue, another Damn&rsquo;d Yankee, this one in Spokane, has problems of another variety.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m living on borrowed time,&rdquo; said Enoch A. Sears, 84, &ldquo;far past my allotted three score and ten, and I only want peace and quiet.&rdquo;&nbsp; He has filed for divorce from his wife of one year, and has departed his home, leaving it to his wife, 59, and her mother, 79.&nbsp; Enoch simply stated he was &ldquo;too old to become accustomed to living with a mother-in-law.&rdquo;</p>

<div>Los Angeles</div>
<div>April 30, 1907</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Sixtysomething Edward M. Robbins was a Civil War vet and long-time resident of his little house at 2728 Council Street.&nbsp; No one ever entered the threshold of his hermit home; he never spoke to his neighbors nor made sign of recognition when he passed them on the street.&nbsp; He was a quiet and at all times inoffensive man, save for those occasional spells when he would go on a colossal drunk. Then he would be seen through the uncurtained windows strumming an old guitar for a time, until he broke into mad fits of rage, pacing and singing at the top of his voice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Given his hermit-like ways, it was no wonder that Robbins&rsquo;s ten-day disappearance went unnoticed.&nbsp; But then passersby observed the multitude of flies on the windows&hellip;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Police broke in to find Robbins on a bed he&rsquo;d covered in wrapping paper. Bowie knife, razor and pair of scissors were all nearby, all besmeared with blood, as Robbins had used them all on his wrists and ankles.&nbsp; But what led to his self-destruction was a &ldquo;queerly fashioned double barreled pistol of ancient make&rdquo; that Robbins still gripped tight in his decomposing hand, one barrel having been discharged to form a gaping hole in his neck.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Perhaps Robbins suffered from the mania associated with the&nbsp; &ldquo;flashing back&rdquo; of memory common to veterans of the War of Northern Agression.</div>
</div>
