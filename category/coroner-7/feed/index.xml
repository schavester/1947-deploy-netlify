<p>Following up yesterday&rsquo;s story about whether one Ray McCoy was lynched for looking too much like Edward Hickman&hellip;</p>
<p>The verdict of the Coroner&rsquo;s jury?&nbsp; Jail officials and other prisoners, all vindicated.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it seems that Ralph &ldquo;Ray McCoy&rdquo; Fuller raised the ire of Angelenos in the grip of Hickman fever, whose Hickmanmania (Hickmania?&nbsp; Hickmentia?) led an angry mob to chase down and beat Fuller something fierce, believing the twenty year-old to be Hickman, after Fuller robbed a store at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=242+S+Main+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90012&#038;sll=34.050606,-118.245104&#038;sspn=0.002018,0.0036&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.051397,-118.245099&#038;spn=0.008071,0.014398&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="meyers">242 South Main</a> and was chased two blocks on foot.</p>
<p>Fellow prisoner Fred Meadows told the Times that once in the hoosegow, the sullen and reserved Fuller was regarded as just another popped burglar.&nbsp; Meadows related how he and the boys started playing &ldquo;Sundown&rdquo; in an outer tank and when he returned, Fuller had hanged himself with Meadows&rsquo; scarf.&nbsp; (Must be nice to have scarves.&nbsp; And <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/los_angeles_metro/la-me-jail27nov27,1,3016141.story?track=rss" target="_blank" title="andfreedom">pianos</a>.)</p>
<p>In other lynching news, any and all information regarding Hickman&rsquo;s departure and route from Pendleton (where he was exhibited in a cage like a circus animal) to Los Angeles County Jail is being kept under strict secrecy. &nbsp;</p>

</span><span style="font-size:100%;">A woman living on a hog ranch near the Santa Fe railroad crossing over the Los Angeles River contacted police after seeing dismembered human bodies in the old dumping ground near George Street.<br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;">Investigators dug through the dump, retrieving the body of a child that was nearly intact, along with bits and pieces of a man and a woman, including their skulls. In addition to the remains, police found books and papers traced to the University of Southern California Medical School.<br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"> Ã¢â‚¬Å“Whoever is responsible for the depositing of the remains on the garbage heap should be severely censured,Ã¢â‚¬Â <a href="https://1947project.com/tags/lanterman">Coroner Roy S. Lanterman</a></span><span style="font-size:100%;"> told The Times.<br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;">Ã¢â‚¬Å“It seems quite heartless enough to give up the human body to further science but when the students have finished dissecting the remains they should see that they are interred with the proper respect. I cannot understand the action of those responsible for sending the bodies to the garbage heap.Ã¢â‚¬Â<br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;">For further reading on the sorry state of medical schools at the turn of the 20th century, read Abraham FlexnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&#038;hl=en&amp;lr=&#038;safe=off&amp;amp;amp;q=%22abraham+flexner%22+%22medical+education%22&amp;btnG=Search">Medical Education in the U.S. and Canada</a></span><span style="font-size:100%;">.Ã¢â‚¬Â Note that in this era, medical students didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even need to be high school graduates.<br />

<div>Hollywood has been rife with excited talk over the recent death of area man T. C. Hoagland.&nbsp; Hoagland, of Olive Street, raised the interest of locals when his formerly attending physicians, unsure of the cause of this life&rsquo;s cessation, refused to sign a death certificate after Hoagland&rsquo;s demise. Hoagland&rsquo;s cadaver was handed over to a Dr. G. W. Campbell, who therefore performed an autopsy.&nbsp; The rumors afloat among Hoagland&rsquo;s Hollywood neighbors were lessened somewhat when it was revealed that there had been no foul play; rather, Hoagland had simply died of alcoholism.<!-- D(["mb","<span>Ã¯Â¿Â½ </span>This should have come as a surprise to no-one, given HoaglandÃ¯Â¿Â½s reputation for heavy drinking, but the rumors remain unquelled.<span>Ã¯Â¿Â½ </span>An inquest has been ordered and the Coroner shall further investigate HoaglandÃ¯Â¿Â½s death.</div>

<div>Los Angeles</div>



<div>April 30, 1907</div>



<div>Ã¯Â¿Â½</div>



<div>Sixtysomething Edward M. Robbins was a Civil War vet and long-time resident of his little house at 2728 Council Street.<span>Ã¯Â¿Â½ </span>No one ever entered the threshold of his hermit home; he never spoke to his neighbors nor made sign of recognition when he passed them on the street.<span>Ã¯Â¿Â½ </span>He was a quiet and at all times inoffensive man, save for those occasional spells when he would go on a colossal drunk. Then he would be seen through the uncurtained windows strumming an old guitar for a time, until he broke into mad fits of rage, pacing and singing at the top of his voice.</div>



<div>Ã¯Â¿Â½</div>



<div>Given his hermit-like ways, it was no wonder that RobbinsÃ¯Â¿Â½s ten-day disappearance went unnoticed.<span>Ã¯Â¿Â½ </span>But then passersby observed the multitude of flies on the windowsÃ¯Â¿Â½</div>



<div>Ã¯Â¿Â½</div>



<div>Police broke in to find Robbins on a bed heÃ¯Â¿Â½d covered in wrapping paper. Bowie knife, razor and pair of scissors were all nearby, all besmeared with blood, as Robbins had used them all on his wrists and ankles.<span>Ã¯Â¿Â½ </span>But what led to his self-destruction was a Ã¯Â¿Â½queerly fashioned double barreled pistol of ancient makeÃ¯Â¿Â½ that Robbins still gripped tight in his decomposing hand, one barrel having been discharged to form a gaping hole in his neck.</div>



<div>Perhaps Robbins suffered from the mania associated with the<span>Ã¯Â¿Â½ </span>Ã¯Â¿Â½flashing backÃ¯Â¿Â½ of memory common to veterans of the War of Northern Agression.</div>
