<p>The good people of Los Angeles were reminded today of a quieter, simpler time&mdash;a time known as &quot;1921&quot;.&nbsp; A magical time of Teapot Domes, and Tulsa Tumults, and shotgun blasts to the face.&nbsp; We collectively remembered the sensational <a title="21kennedyshooting" target="_blank" href="https://www.prairiepublic.org/programs/datebook/bydate/06/1006/101706.jsp">trial</a> of <a title="goodtimes" target="_blank" href="https://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E0DE1D61731EF33A2575BC0A96E9C946095D6CF">Arthur C. Burch</a> and Madalynne Obenchain, dismissed following jury disagreements, regarding the August 6, 1921 <a title="aniceplacetoraiseyourkidsupin" target="_blank" href="https://www.latimes.com/classified/realestate/printedition/la-re-guide20apr20,1,5314444.story?ctrack=1&#038;cset=true">Beverly Glen</a> shooting and .12 gauge buckshot that took apart J. Belton Kennedy&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; (And now, our obligatory Kennedy &quot;Gaelic For Ugly Head&quot; Kennedy evidence:&nbsp; the shots were fired from a clump of bushes [California:&nbsp; growing better grassy knolls since 1850]; the first shot missed; there was a beautiful woman at the scene, and mysterious tramps&#8230;anyway.)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="336" height="400" border="0" align="left" title="TwoMen" alt="TwoMen" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2046/2235650943_fbbc50e99b_o.gif" />Seems that J. Belton&rsquo;s father, John D. Kennedy, of <a title="KennedyKompound" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=844+S+Westlake+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90057&#038;sll=34.054148,-118.277087&#038;sspn=0.001947,0.003219&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.055539,-118.277092&#038;spn=0.007787,0.012875&#038;t=h&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=0">844 South Westlake</a>, never got over the death of his son, or the exoneration of the accused.&nbsp; So today the sixty two year-old is in court on the charge of assault and battery.&nbsp; He headed over to the Terminal Warehouse Building on East 7th where Burch worked in the insurance game.&nbsp; As Burch was innocently hauling some fire extinguishers from one place to another, he suddenly heard &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting a long time but now I&rsquo;ve got you!&rdquo; &ndash; and was then struck in the face and seized by the throat, but was rescued before he felt the last bit of life choked from him. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Authorities were summoned, and said Kennedy the Elder, later, &ldquo;The affair occurred when my emotions overcame me.&nbsp; I have no regrets and will gladly account for my actions at the proper time and place.&nbsp; When I went in the building no such idea entered my mind, but when I saw him [Burch] coming down the hall I could not restrain myself.<br />&ldquo;This is the fist time I have met him fact to face since his trials for the murder of my boy.&nbsp; At the sight of him I was seized with a frenzy and choked him until he began squealing and they came and separated us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe he has some pathetic obsession toward me,&rdquo; Burch declared. </p>
<p>Mrs. Obenchain, living in seclusion in Los Angeles, declined to comment on the matter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On February 21, John D. Kennedy changed his plea from not guilty to guilty and Municipal Judge Richardson gave him thirty days, suspended, with the caveat:&nbsp; that if Kennedy saw Burch coming, Kennedy was to &ldquo;go to the other side of the street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That, Kennedy said, he could do.</p>

<div>February 1, 1927<br />Whittier</p>
<p>Family annihilator <a href="https://laurajames.typepad.com/clews/2005/08/if_ever_a_man_d.html" target="_blank">George Hassell</a> was convicted of killing his wife and her eight children by his late brother, and has an appointment with the Texas executioner shortly. While awaiting his last date, George recalled the wife he killed in Whittier in 1917 and the three children he buried with her beneath their little home at 236 South Whittier Avenue. There seemed no reason not to confess this, so today, with some direction from long-suspicious neighbor Myrtle Lark and a little more from the agreeable killer, Constable Bob Way crawled under the house and unearthed the body of an infant. Its mother and siblings soon followed, thus explaining the wretched odors that had long plagued the spot.</p>
<p>In slightly gayer news, the grand new Mayfair Hotel has opened in the Crown Hill district of Los Angeles, providing the ideal vantage point for a drunken oil company exec named Ray Chandler to hole up for days with his secretary while threatening suicide to all who&#8217;ll listen.</p>

<p>December 24, 1927<br />Los Angeles </p>
<p>Dominating newspaper headlines for the past several days has been the slaying of twelve year old school girl, Marion Parker. Her killer, William Edward Hickman, is currently in Oregon awaiting extradition. He&rsquo;ll return by train under heavy guard to Los Angeles, where he faces the death penalty for the horrific crime. </p>
<p>Long before newspapers were delivered to the doorsteps of most American homes, information was spread by song &ndash; and it&rsquo;s a practice that continues to this day. Ballads have been written about floods, mining disasters, shipwrecks, and murder. Marion Parker&rsquo;s tragic story inspired prolific song writer <a title="Rev Andrew Jenkins" href="https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-887" target="_blank">Reverend Andrew Jenkins</a> of Atlanta, Georgia to pen the poignant &ldquo;Ballad of Marian [sic] Parker&rdquo;. </p>
<p>The Ballad of Marian Parker</p>
<p>&#8216;Way out in California,<br />A family bright and gay<br />Were preparing for their Christmas<br />Not very far away.</p>
<p>They had a little daughter,<br />A sweet and pretty child.<br />And everyone who knew her<br />Loved Marian Parker&#8217;s smile.</p>
<p>She left her home one morning<br />For her school not far away.<br />And no one dreamed that danger,<br />Was lurking near that day.</p>
<p>But then a murdrous villain,<br />A fiend with heart of stone,<br />Took little Marian Parker<br />Away from friends and home.</p>
<p>The world was horror-stricken,<br />The people held their breath,<br />Until they found poor Marian,<br />Her body cold in death.</p>
<p>They hunted for the coward,<br />Young Hickman was their man.<br />They brought him back to justice,<br />His final trial to stand.</p>
<p>The jury found him guilty,<br />Of course they could not fail.<br />He must be executed<br />Soon in San Quentin jail.</p>
<p>And while he waits his sentence,<br />Let&#8217;s hope he learns to pray<br />To make his black soul ready<br />For the great judgement day.</p>
<p>There is a great commandment<br />That says, &quot;Thou shalt not kill&quot;<br />And those who do not head it,<br />Their cup of sorrow fill </p>

<p>December 20, 1927<br />Los Angeles</p>
<p>As police scour the Bellevue Arms apartment*of &quot;Donald Evans&quot; (an alias for Marion Parker&#8217;s purported slayer Edward Hickman, otherwise known as The Fox), they find portions of a chocolate cake, broken golf clubs, and dirty dishes suggesting a hurried departure. Marion&#8217;s father Perry, upon discovering that the suspect is a former employee at his Seventh and Spring Street bank who he dismissed on fraud charges, says that the voice on the telephone demanding the $1500 ransom was similar to Hickman&#8217;s peculiarly blas&eacute; speech patterns when discussing his offense, but that at no time did he believe the young man meant harm to him or his family. </p>
<p>Little Marion&#8217;s outraged body lies in the morgue, a tiny, heartbreaking bundle with her missing limbs, hollowed core and unseeing eyes sewn open in doll-like pretence of life. In one small mercy, the Parker&#8217;s neighbor is the Autopsy Surgeon, and it&#8217;s this Dr. Wagner who makes the identification and pieces his little friend together from the parts that are brought in, wrapped in newspaper, from where they were scattered in Elysian Park. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The reward for The Fox&#8217; capture has swelled to $62,400, with new pledges from outraged citizens, radio stations and fraternal organizations arriving hourly. Will The Fox be snared, or will he slip away to menace other cities, other daughters? Tune in tomorrow to find out!</p>
<p>*attention, modern readers: the Bellevue Arms is the partly boarded up, expansive brick apartment building flush against the 101 freeway heading north out of downtown. The Fox&#8217; lair was upstairs in the middle rear of the Western, burned-out wing. If you decide to visit, you&#8217;ll come via Sunset Boulevard, and via&#8230; <strong>MARION</strong>.</p>

Vernon Junior High, saying, &quot;I spoke with Mrs Holt, and am satisfied that I would have acted as she did if I were confronted with the same circumstances.&quot;</p>
<p>Holt excused Marion Parker from school on Thursday, December 15 when a slender man came to the desk and asked for &quot;P.M. Parker&#8217;s youngest daughter,&quot; saying that her father had been in an automobile accident.&nbsp; Holt hesitated, knowing that Marion was a twin.&nbsp; However, the man persisted, saying, &quot;I am an employee at the bank where Mr. Parker is chief clerk, and if there is any doubt in your mind, here is the bank&#8217;s telephone number.&nbsp; You may call there.&quot;</p>
<p>Convinced, Holt sent an office assistant to get Marian from class.&nbsp; &quot;Marion was nervous and excited when I told her that her father had been injured.&nbsp; The news completely broke up a little Christmas party the children were having in their room, and Marion had some of the refreshments in her hands when she came into the room.&nbsp; But at once she forgot about everything but her father.&quot;</p>
<p>Marion was excused from school, and left with the man who would, three days later, end her life.</p>
<p>After the kidnapping, Holt said, &quot;Oh, I can think of many things I could have done now.&nbsp; I never would have let Marion go but for the apparent sincerity and disarming manner of the man.&quot;</p>
<p>Private funeral services for 12-year-old Marion Parker were held today at the Little Church of Flowers at Forest Lawn Cemetery, after which her body was cremated.&nbsp; The search for her killer continues, with police and citizens as far away as Denver and Portland on the lookout for the Fox.</p></div>

<p>December 18, 1927 <br />Los Angeles  </p>
<p>This morning&#8217;s headline was set in the giant typeface reserved for only very good or very bad news. This time it was the latter:  &quot;Kidnaped [sic] Child Slain By Fiend.&quot; For three days now, Angelenos have followed the story of 12-year-old Marian Parker, lured away from Mount Vernon High School by a man who said her father was ill. The kidnapper demanded $1500 (close to $18,000 in 2007) for her safe return, and Marian&#8217;s father agreed to pay it.   </p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lperil/2122206832/" title="The suitcase by peril61, on Flickr"><img loading="lazy" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2346/2122206832_5615e008d8.jpg" width="366" height="336" ALIGN="right" alt="The suitcase" /></a></p>
<p>Shortly after 8 o&#8217;clock last night, the kidnapper drove up to the agreed-upon meeting place. Marian&#8217;s small form was visible in the passenger seat. &quot;Here&#8217;s your child,&quot; he told Parker. &quot;Give me the money and follow instructions. She&#8217;s asleep now.&quot; The ransom changed hands; the criminal drove a short way and deposited Marian&#8217;s blanket-wrapped figure on the lawn at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=432+South+Manhattan+Place,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=66.457072,103.886719&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.06729,-118.310351&#038;spn=0.008674,0.012681&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="Where Marian's body was found">432 South Manhattan Place</a>. Perry Parker rushed to his daughter, scooped her up and&mdash;in a waking nightmare that must have haunted him for the rest of his days&mdash;discovered she was dead, her eyes wired or sewn open in a hideous simulacrum of life. A wire was bound so tightly around her neck that it cut deeply into her flesh; she had been disemboweled and her legs hacked off close to her body. The <em>Times</em> was filled with stories comparing the Parker case to Leopold and Loeb and a host of other grisly child murderers. Crowds of bloodthirsty thrill seekers (the <em>Times</em> estimated over 25,000) thronged past the Parker household at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=1631+South+Wilton+Place&#038;sll=34.06729,-118.310351&#038;sspn=0.008674,0.012681&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.043734,-118.314471&#038;spn=0.008677,0.012681&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="The Parker Family Home">1631 South Wilton Place</a> (address helpfully supplied by the paper).   </p>
<p>The horror continued today. While most of Los Angeles was still reading its morning papers, citizens aiding the police found five gruesome bundles on a lonely road in Elysian Park. The first contained Marian&#8217;s arms and legs; the last, found by &quot;two small boys, carrying on the search,&quot; held her viscera. A blood-soaked suitcase previously discovered in the gutter at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=620+South+Manhattan,+los+angeles&#038;sll=34.063397,-118.31033&#038;sspn=0.008675,0.012681&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.063877,-118.31033&#038;spn=0.008675,0.012681&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="Where the suitcase was found">620 South Manhattan</a> place is believed to have held the child&#8217;s body. Then, late this evening, the police found an abandoned Ford roadster, license number 667-67. It is believed to be the automobile driven by the kidnapper to the meeting with Marian&#8217;s father.   </p>

<p>December 17, 1927 <br />Ossining, NY <img loading="lazy" title="Ruth Snyder" height="229" alt="Ruth Snyder" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2029/2118859314_1e2b88168a_m.jpg" width="240" align="right" border="0" /></p>
<p>Mrs. Ruth Snyder has a date with Sing Sing&rsquo;s electric chair on January 12, 1928, unless her plea for executive clemency is granted. </p>
<p>The seductive blonde and her lover, corset salesman Judd Gray (see photo), were both tried and convicted of murdering Ruth&rsquo;s husband by caving in his skull with a window sash weight, strangling him with a garrote fashioned out of picture wire and a gold pen, and finally stuffing chloroform soaked rags into his nostrils. </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="Judd Gray" height="240" alt="Judd Gray" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2407/2118796958_ebb380e852_m.jpg" width="175" align="left" border="0" />If there is an explanation for the obvious overkill in the murder of Albert Snyder, it must be that Ruth&rsquo;s previous attempts to snuff out the life of her husband (twice by asphyxiation and once by poison) had failed &ndash; and she wasn&rsquo;t about to give up. Ruth had persuaded her husband to take out a double indemnity policy, which would pay&nbsp;her in the event of his accidental death. It was the lure of the $97,000 worth of life insurance that compelled her to continue with her diabolical schemes until she succeeded. </p>
<p>Fueled by two bottles of whiskey and profound stupidity, the criminally-challenged duo staged the murder scene as a burglary gone horribly wrong. But their pathetic plan was doomed to failure. They threw an Italian language newspaper on the floor as a false clue to the identity of the killers. They emptied dresser drawers and overturned chairs. And in an act that would eventually help prosecutors to prove her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, Ruth hid her allegedly stolen jewelry under her mattress, about three feet away from Albert&rsquo;s battered body! </p>
<p>The trial of Ruth and Judd would be a media circus, and celebrities such as director D.W. Griffith, and evangelists Billy Sunday and Aimee Semple McPherson would attend. Ruth would be called &ldquo;ruthless Ruth&rdquo;, &ldquo;vampire&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;blonde fiend&rdquo; by the press. Evidently not all men found those appellations a turn-off, because Ruth received at least 160 marriage proposals during her incarceration. <img loading="lazy" title="DEAD" height="312" alt="DEAD" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2268/2118797280_b48c64d100_o.jpg" width="217" align="right" border="0" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately for Ruth, her plea for clemency would be denied by Governor Al Smith. Her execution would be famously recorded by newspaper man Tom Howard. The ingenious reporter had strapped a miniature <a title="ankle camera" href="https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object.cfm?key=35&#038;objkey=160" target="_blank">camera</a> to his ankle beneath his trousers. Just as the executioner threw the switch on the whimpering murderess, Tom raised the cuff of his pants and snapped the tabloid photo of a lifetime. </p>
<p>The murderers were unexceptional, but their crime inspired art. <a title="Machinal" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machinal" target="_blank">&ldquo;Machinal&rdquo;,</a> a play by Sophie Treadwell was deemed one of the best of 1928-29. <a title="James M Cain" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_M_Cain" target="_blank">James M. Cain&rsquo;s</a> brilliant novels &ldquo;Double Indemnity&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Postman Always Rings Twice&rdquo; are said to have been inspired by Albert Snyder&rsquo;s murder. And, of course, each of the novels translated into two of the finest examples of film noir ever produced. </p>

<p>Convicted murderer Baldomero Rodrigues was legally executed twice today in the Pinar del Rio prison. The means of execution was the <a title="garrote" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrote" target="_blank">garrote</a>, a macabre relic from the Spanish colonization of Cuba. The prisoner was shackled hand and foot, and then placed in the device which would strangle him to death. At least that was the plan. </p>
<p>Following the initial garroting the supposed dead man was laid on a stretcher to be borne to his grave, when he suddenly sprang to life! With no thought of sparing the resurrected felon, prison officials overpowered the struggling man and forced him once again into the death machine. The strangulation band was adjusted more carefully this time, and Rodrigues remained on the machine for twenty-two minutes before he was officially pronounced dead. </p>
