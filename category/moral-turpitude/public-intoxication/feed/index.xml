<div align="left"><img loading="lazy" width="240" height="115" border="0" align="left" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2156/2214021308_b29ba6728a_m.jpg" alt="latour" title="latour" />W.H. Latour, a 71-year-old night watchman at the Lamanda Park Citrus Packing Plant in Pasadena, was propped up with a bottle of white lightning when he caught Tom Clark working on his car on the plant grounds.&nbsp; When Latour told him to leave, Clark nodded, and prepared to set off on his way.</p>
<p>But then, Latour became convinced that the car was trying to attack him, and pulled a gun on it.&nbsp; After firing two shots at Clark&#8217;s car, Latour raised his arm to wave off the terrifying apparition and fired again &#8212; directly into his own hand.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Los Angeles today, another man paid a less gory price for intemperance.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="240" height="109" border="0" align="right" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2294/2213228409_0225dc4a46_m.jpg" alt="sober" title="sober" />Earlier this month, police were called to <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=mt.+washington+dr.,+los+angeles&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=31.150864,59.765625&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.099332,-118.21641&#038;spn=0.015885,0.029182&#038;z=15&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=0" target="_blank" title="mtwashingtondr">Mt. Washington Dr.</a> following reports of a dead body slumped in a car along the side of the road.&nbsp; But James Proffit wasn&#8217;t dead &#8212; only dead drunk, and &quot;there were several dead soldiers around him in the form of empty bottles from which the spirits had fled.&quot;</p>
<p>Today in court, Proffit had some interesting things to say for himself.&nbsp; &quot;It&#8217;s the holidays and festivities that get me in trouble,&quot; Proffit told Municipal Judge Turney.&nbsp; &quot;I was in jail at Thanksgiving for being drunk, and it was the same thing at Christmas and New Year&#8217;s.&nbsp; I wouldn&#8217;t be here now, but my brother got married, and of course, I was there as a guest.&quot;</p>
<p>Turns out, Proffit had forgotten his duty to drive the newlyweds home from the reception.&nbsp; When he swerved off the road and got them all stuck in the mud, the bride and groom decided to walk the rest of the way home, leaving Proffit to fend for himself.&nbsp; Proffit was fined $200.</p></div>
