<p>Finally the landlady came to the rescue.&nbsp; &ldquo;CAIN,&rdquo; she shouted into the telephone, &ldquo;C-a-i-n.&nbsp; You know, the man that killed his brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That set off the other party on the phone all right&hellip;<strong><em>murder!</em></strong>&nbsp; The police were summoned and Harry Cain was in jail in a matter of minutes.&nbsp; It took hauling the landlady in some time later to explicate the whole mess.</p>

<p>But the hoarse-voice chap wasn&rsquo;t five miles outside of town; he had instead hightailed it over to Lawrence Ferguson&rsquo;s home.&nbsp; Hoarsey and a buddy paid a visit to the abandoned <em>Mrs</em>. Ferguson, where they stuffed a large wad of chloroform-soaked cotton in her mouth and nostrils, knocking her out and, according to authorities, did so nearly permanently, which would have added murder on top of robbery, and making prank phone calls.</p>
<p>The robbery part, incidentally, netted the robbers three diamond rings worth $1,800 ($19,854 USD 2006) plus a silver saxophone, some jeweled wristwatches, overcoats, the money hidden in the mattress (how many times do we have to tell you people?) (and not in the Bible, either) and Mr. Ferguson&rsquo;s revolver.&nbsp; And his <a title="atanyprice" target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/2006/04/10/expensive-musical-instruments_cx_mr_0411musicinst.html">Stradivarius</a>, <a title="illtaketwo" target="_blank" href="https://jscms.jrn.columbia.edu/cns/2007-04-24/meierdierkslehman-violinappraisialflaws">valued</a> at $<a title="cheapasfree" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/03/nyregion/03violin.html">400</a> ($<a title="whatabouthisovercoat" target="_blank" href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/entertainment/4988838.stm">4,411</a> USD 2006).</p>

<p>But now he&rsquo;s gone <em>too far</em>.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s making <em>rude phone calls</em>.</p>
<p>Richie was hauled before Justice Rose to defend a complaint sworn by Mrs. Rose Mustactia, Richie&rsquo;s grocer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been annoying me for some time.&nbsp; At first he just said spiteful things, but at last his actions became unbearable.&nbsp; Saturday afternoon he called up the store and told me his name and then he began to abuse me.&nbsp; He called me names and my husband names and said we were bums and that all our groceries were stale and that most of the stuff we had in the store was second hand.&nbsp; The next time he called up, my daughter answered the &lsquo;phone.&nbsp; He told her the same thing, abusing us all and saying hard things about us.&nbsp; Twenty-five times during the afternoon and evening he called us up and used bad language until we refused to answer the &lsquo;phone any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richie was convicted of a misdemeanor.</p>
