<p>In March of 1926 Alice&#8217;s husband M. J. Hanmore, a Fullerton oil worker, began experiencing stomach pains and loss of appetite; Drs. Claude E. Steen, Emerald J. Steen and John A.

<p>(Our evangelical docs Steen &amp; Steen will make the papers again in March, charged of malpractice by one Mary A.

<p>August 3, 1927 </p>
<p>On this slow news day, readers of the Los Angeles Times were treated to a pair of interesting stories on page A8. The first was a five paragraph reprint from American Druggist magazine introducing Ben D. Rinehart, acting pharmacist for the Ringling-Barnum &amp; Bailey circus. You probably never stopped to think that a 600-pound fat lady might need three times the normal dose for a sleeping potion to work, but Ben has. He&#8217;s also proud of his rickets treatments for elephants, who consume quarts of cod liver oil and are wrapped in bandages the size of bedsheets.</p>
<p>More whimsical still was the piece entitled &quot;How To Walk On Air.&quot; How, you ask? Why, via that new and enervating sport of Balloon Jumping, as proposed in The Forum Magazine. Just grab hold of a big balloon with just slightly less lift than your weight and LEAP, over buildings, lakes and elephants with rickets! Mr. (wait for it) Frederick S. Hoppin is convinced that we&#8217;re at the outset of an age of shoulder-mounted gaspacks when everyone will have the ability to gambol about bearing just a portion of their natural weight. &quot;Our whole present-day world would be turned upside-down. Legislatures will be busily engaged in passing laws prohibiting people from leaving the earth too freely, or rules for the right of way up and down and sideways, or regulations against landing on the head of a fellow citizen or planting a foot on any part of him as you rise. And then there would be the new rule of etiquette: should you pass over or around a lady?&quot;</p>
<p>All right, class: discuss.&nbsp;  </p>

Los Angeles  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">An 11:30 a.m. blast caused by an accumulation of gas shattered the Rawson building at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&amp;q=114+W+2nd+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90012&#038;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;z=18&#038;ll=34.050886,-118.244428&amp;spn=0.001151,0.004206&#038;t=h&amp;om=0">114 W. 2<sup>nd</sup> St.</a> in an explosion blamed on a gas company employee who struck a match to check the meter. Four people were killed immediately while three more died of their injuries and 30 were hurt, some of them so badly that their crushed limbs were amputated.<span style="">  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The explosion killed two waitresses, La Von Meyers and Annie Crawford; retired farmer John W. Main; and tailor J.M.C. Fuentes. Charles G. Haggerdy, who worked in a tailor shop, died a few days later of his injuries, as did janitor Ferdinand Stephen.</p>
<p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://www.lmharnisch.com/images/1907_0215A.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="//www.lmharnisch.com/images/1907_0215A.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Waitress May Anderson, 25, who also worked at the Anchor Laundry,<span style="">  </span>lingered for months before she died. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Although she suffered excruciating pain, she bore up bravely,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The doctors and nurses said that only her grit kept her alive. She realized that she could not live, however, and her great regret was that she would have to part from her mother, a devoted and constant attendant at the hospital cot.Ã¢â‚¬Â   </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Mr. Cressaty, the restaurant proprietor, said it was only after he made a series of complaints to the Los Angeles Gas and Electric Co. that Harvey A. Holderman came to inspect the meter and called for assistance. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ã¢â‚¬Å“It is at this point that stories conflict,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times says. Ã¢â‚¬Å“It was asserted by some of the restaurant employees who escaped that [Charles J.] Blumenthal or Holderman lit a match to make an inspection under the floor of the supposed leaky pipes. They had already turned off the gas at the main.Ã¢â‚¬Â</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Although gas company officials denied that the workers struck a match, one company employee testified at the inquest that inspectors sometimes used matches for illumination because they didn&#8217;t have flashlights. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A fund drive to aid victims of the explosion raised nearly $10,000 ($205,235.70 USD 2005). </p>

Los Angeles</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!-- [if !supportEmptyParas]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">About 1 a.m. on a dark corner at East Adams and South San Pedro, the hard, shabby life of William Ross ended when he said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“What in hell are you fellows up to?,Ã¢â‚¬Â drew a pistol and shot plainclothes Officer C.A. May.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!-- [if !supportEmptyParas]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">May and his partner, J.M. Hoover, were walking east on Adams when they encountered Ross, described as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“rather roughly dressed man.Ã¢â‚¬Â Earlier in the evening, Hoover and May, who were working plainclothes as part of a crackdown on burglaries in the area, investigated an incident at 223 E. Jefferson Blvd., where L.C. Kelker had reported that two men were on his front porch.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!-- [if !supportEmptyParas]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The officers warned the two men to leave, but did not arrest them as there appeared to be no criminal intent, The Times says. One of the men started into the house, threatening to get a gun and Ã¢â‚¬Å“doÃ¢â‚¬Â the officers, but May and Hoover left without taking any action.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!-- [if !supportEmptyParas]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Later that evening, May and Hoover encountered Ross and suspected he might have been one of the men they encountered outside KelkerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home. May threw back his coat to reveal his badge and said: Ã¢â‚¬Å“We want to know who you are and what you are doing here at this time of night.Ã¢â‚¬Â</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!-- [if !supportEmptyParas]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ross said: Ã¢â‚¬Å“What in hell are you fellows up to? My name is Ross and I live just around the corner.Ã¢â‚¬Â Then he stepped back, drew a pistol and shot May in the shoulder or the chest.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!-- [if !supportEmptyParas]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He fired at Hoover, who ducked and shot Ross in the forehead.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Police found some papers on RossÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ body, a little money and newspaper clippings from the Herald, one about a suicide attempt by Mrs. Mary Ross of 383 or 583 Central Ave. over domestic problems and a legal notice of Mrs. Mary Ross suing William Ross for divorce.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lmharnisch.com/images/1907_0203A.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 220px; height: 199px;" src="//www.lmharnisch.com/images/1907_0203A.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">May was taken to Clara Barton Hospital, where he initially showed progress, although doctors were unable to locate the bullet.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!-- [if !supportEmptyParas]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Investigators eventually found RossÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ room at the Good Samaritan Mission, a homeless shelter at Ord Street and San Fernando near the Plaza, but there were no stolen items or any other evidence that he had been committing burglaries. Police also learned that he had been employed at one time at Pacific Carriage Works, 122 S. San Pedro.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!-- [if !supportEmptyParas]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">May was sent home to 2139Ã‚Â½ S. Los Angeles St. to recover, but the wound became infected and he returned to the hospital. Doctors were unable to locate the bullet and May died Feb. 28, 1907, with his wife and two brothers at his side.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lmharnisch.com/images/1907_0203B.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 245px; height: 526px;" src="//www.lmharnisch.com/images/1907_0203B.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a></p>

</span><span style="font-size:100%;">A woman living on a hog ranch near the Santa Fe railroad crossing over the Los Angeles River contacted police after seeing dismembered human bodies in the old dumping ground near George Street.<br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;">Investigators dug through the dump, retrieving the body of a child that was nearly intact, along with bits and pieces of a man and a woman, including their skulls. In addition to the remains, police found books and papers traced to the University of Southern California Medical School.<br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"> Ã¢â‚¬Å“Whoever is responsible for the depositing of the remains on the garbage heap should be severely censured,Ã¢â‚¬Â <a href="https://1947project.com/tags/lanterman">Coroner Roy S. Lanterman</a></span><span style="font-size:100%;"> told The Times.<br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;">Ã¢â‚¬Å“It seems quite heartless enough to give up the human body to further science but when the students have finished dissecting the remains they should see that they are interred with the proper respect. I cannot understand the action of those responsible for sending the bodies to the garbage heap.Ã¢â‚¬Â<br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;">For further reading on the sorry state of medical schools at the turn of the 20th century, read Abraham FlexnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“<a href="https://www.google.com/search?num=100&#038;hl=en&amp;lr=&#038;safe=off&amp;amp;amp;q=%22abraham+flexner%22+%22medical+education%22&amp;btnG=Search">Medical Education in the U.S. and Canada</a></span><span style="font-size:100%;">.Ã¢â‚¬Â Note that in this era, medical students didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even need to be high school graduates.<br />

</span><span style="font-size:100%;">Henry Carter was the first to fall ill. Assuming some other cause, he encouraged his daughter and Abbott to take a hike while he stayed behind. They were too ill to go far, however, and returned to the cabin, where they ate another can of pork and beans.<br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
