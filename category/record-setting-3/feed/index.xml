<p>January 27, 1927<br />Los Angeles</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="314" height="600" border="0" align="left" title="elasticize" alt="elasticize" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2221/2221884565_08d9ca8491_o.gif" />Hayward Thompson toured Los Angeles today, and pronounced on KFWB this evening (through the courtesy of the Times and <a title="1200sFig" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=1200+S+Figueroa+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90015&#038;sll=34.043752,-118.266921&#038;sspn=0.007788,0.012875&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.043752,-118.266921&#038;spn=0.007788,0.012875&#038;t=h&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=0">Gartzman, Inc</a>, your friendly local <a title="Oakland" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_(automobile)">Oakland</a> distributor) that driving through Los Angeles was going to be a snap.&nbsp; Without the use of his eyes, of course.&nbsp; Seems he doesn&rsquo;t need them&mdash;Thompson was blinded when a German shell took out part of his brain at <a title="1918" target="_blank" href="https://www.geocities.com/Athens/5200/usmc/belleau.htm">Bois de Belleau</a>, and then miraculously regained his sight&mdash;and he&rsquo;s been able to read, golf, shoot rifle matches, since then, while<a title="everybodysdoingit" target="_blank" href="/?p=2037"> blindfolded</a>.</p>
<p>Thompson, 47 years of age though who reportedly looks 30, has made 332 <a title="eyelesssite" target="_blank" href="https://www.answers.com/topic/eyeless-sight">paroptic</a> public exhibhibitions, in every great city of America and Europe, and will make this, his Los Angeles trip, at one hundred miles, his last. </p>
<p>Thompson states that he has more competition here than anywhere else in the world.&nbsp; &ldquo;Driving around Los Angeles I find a good many blind drivers,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I even encountered one who was blind drunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On January 31st, his 333rd exhibition (spooky) Thompson was blindfolded by Deputy Chief of Police Spellman, and did indeed motor one hundred miles through the congested centers of Los Angeles, Hollywood and Pasadena, obeying all signals and laws, without a hitch.</p>
<p>And now he&rsquo;s ceased.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s had to stop because in having only two layers of skin (as opposed to the three you and I have), in conjunction with the fasting he must undergo to sharpen his dermoptic wits, has proven bad for his health. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In retirement, Thompson plans on devoting the rest of his life to hypnotizing people over the radio, via <a title="Mesmer" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Mesmer">Mesmer</a>&rsquo;s system of suggestion.</p>

<p>Driving in Los Angeles is a far cry from the corn-flanked roads of Lawrence, Jimmy.</p>

<p>Who&#8217;s that bobbing in the wind high atop the <a href="https://catalog1.lapl.org/cgi-bin/cw_cgi?fullRecord+6397+968+25710+7+0" target="_blank">Rose Room Ballroom</a> at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=8th+and+spring,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=34.063096,-118.399808&#038;sspn=0.259956,0.449066&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.04377,-118.253639&#038;spn=0.008125,0.014033&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1&#038;msa=0&#038;msid=101386585248378180364.00000113270d45b852ca2" target="_blank">8th and Spring</a>? Why, it&#8217;s The Phantom of the Flagpole, a mask-wearing fella who swears he&#8217;ll break the flagpole sitting record of 17 days and 2 hours set by V.H. Crouch of New Bedford, MA. Just hours after Crouch came down from his eastern pole, The Phantom climbed his. Oh, heavy hangs the crown of the nation&#8217;s greatest flagpole sitter.</p>
<p><em>The Times</em> reports that The Phantom is shaving and eating three meals a day (unsaid is what he does with these meals once he&#8217;s finished with them, if you catch our drift). He smokes 100 cigarettes a day and gulps black coffee most of the night, when he ties himself to the pole, just in case. He&#8217;s reading fiction magazines and would like an adventure novel sent up.</p>
<p>On July 26, The Phantom will call for a cork helmet to avert the awful rays of the sun. When The Phantom of the Flagpole finally comes down to earth on August 5th, he is revealed as Captain Robert Hull, and happily takes possession of a $2500 prize from Rose Room manager Joseph Lederer.</p>
<p>But while you cheer the achievement of our local pigeon, spare a kind thought for poor &quot;Hold Em Joe&quot; Powers, whose perch over the Morrison Hotel in Chicago ended at a disappointing 16 days and two hours on July 15, and unaccountably left him missing six teeth. (Scurvy? An excess of chattering? Only Joe knows, and he ain&#8217;t talking.) </p>
