<p>February 4, 1927 <br />Los Angeles </p>
<p>A police dragnet is closing in on the killers of Luther H. Green.&nbsp; A&nbsp;member of the Los Angeles Stock Exchange, Green was slain outside of his home at <a title="1053 Bonnie Brae" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=1053+south+bonnie+brae,+la,+ca&#038;sll=34.042345,-118.266076&#038;sspn=0.000942,0.001824&#038;layer=&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;om=1&#038;ll=34.060481,-118.27692&#038;spn=0.083621,0.152607&#038;z=13" target="_blank">1053 Bonnie Brae</a>, as he attempted to thwart the hijacking of his $10,000 [$120,710.34 current dollars] stash of pre-prohibition booze. He was able to fire a single shot from his rifle before being mortally wounded by the burglers. </p>
<p>According to Chief of Detectives Cline, six men have been implicated in the aborted liquor heist. It is believed that the ringleader of the failed raid may be the notorious crook, <a title="Mile Away Thomas" href="http://www.47upgradepath7.richardschave.com//node?from=315" target="_blank">Harry &ldquo;Mile-Away&rdquo; Thomas</a>. Mile-Away&rsquo;s mouthpiece, Attorney S.S. Hahn, told cops that he had conferred with his client and, &ldquo;&hellip;he was not only a <em>mile</em> away this time, but <em>sixteen</em> miles away&rdquo;. Harry and several of his confederates would soon be arrested in connection with Green&rsquo;s murder, but none of them would ever stand trial for the crime. </p>
<p>More than a decade prior to the invention of <a title="Teflon" href="http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blteflon.htm" target="_blank">Teflon</a> &reg;, the often busted but rarely convicted non-stick felon would be released on the charges stemming from the Green killing. His lucky streak would end on the evening of April 21, 1927. Harry would be caught in a sting and gunned down by the law as he attempted to steal an expensive automobile from a private garage at <a title="1408 W 35th St" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=1408+W+35th+St,+Los+Angeles,+Los+Angeles,+California+90026,+United+States&#038;sll=34.077332,-118.262393&#038;sspn=0.022287,0.039353&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.025205,-118.296747&#038;spn=0.022301,0.039353&#038;z=15&#038;om=0" target="_blank">1408 West Thirty-Fifth Street</a>. </p>
<p>Riddled with machine-gun bullets, buckshot, and slugs from police revolvers, Harry staggered from the garage and collapsed in the arms of a uniformed officer. Mile-Away&rsquo;s last words before he succumbed to his injuries were &ldquo;Everybody has to fall some time.&rdquo; </p>

<p>December 22, 1927<br />Los Angeles</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put up our feet and see what&rsquo;s gone on in the world this day.&nbsp; Not much.&nbsp; The odd curiosity or two.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><img loading="lazy" width="249" height="195" border="0" align="right" title="hemp" alt="hemp" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2197/2131536350_30713e4032_o.jpg" /><br />According to our concerned friends at the paper, it seems the Mexicans are making a menace of themselves, using flowers of the &ldquo;hemp&rdquo; plant as some sort of habit-forming drug (they&rsquo;re such a resourceful people!).&nbsp; Apparently the Imperial Linen Products Company has blanketed the Imperial Valley with the stuff.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;m sure the <a title="nexttheredcar" target="_blank" href="http://www.world-mysteries.com/marijuana1.htm">State</a> will sort this one out to everybody&rsquo;s satisfaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="253" height="200" border="0" align="left" title="onelastcig" alt="onelastcig" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2236/2131536354_cd46111e8d_o.jpg" />Oh dear, here&rsquo;s <a title="kaboom" target="_blank" href="https://1947project.com/?p=2189">another</a> fellow who just couldn&rsquo;t resist a final cigarette.&nbsp; Seems J. B. Smith left the wife at his <a title="jbsHouse" target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=420+west+maple,+glendale,+ca&#038;sll=34.291509,-118.432102&#038;sspn=0.016062,0.029182&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.138662,-118.261557&#038;spn=0.008045,0.014591&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1">Glendale home</a> and checked into the LaViolette Hotel on <a title="kablooie" target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=N+Maclay+Ave,+San+Fernando,+Los+Angeles,+California,+United+States&#038;sll=34.28393,-118.43869&#038;sspn=0.008031,0.014591&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;cd=1&#038;geocode=0,34.290020,-118.432120&#038;ll=34.291509,-118.432102&#038;spn=0.016062,0.029182&#038;z=15&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1">North Maclay</a> in San Fernando.&nbsp; He brought with him a stack of goodbye letters indicating his fears about going mad, and a loaf of bread&mdash;not for snacking, but for soaking in water and wadding into the wafty windows and drafty doors (my hat off again to the resourcefulness of our Southlanders).&nbsp; Of course, no-one banks on the dang&rsquo;d jets taking so <em>long</em>.&nbsp; Thankfully J. B. also brought along a pack of <a title="ifyagotem" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIN8MmMloZE">smokes</a> to pass the time&hellip;the hole blown in the wall was six feet in diameter.&nbsp; J. B.&#8217;s smoldering remains lived long enough to say goodbye to his wife at the hospital, but not much longer than that.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="233" height="149" border="0" align="right" title="ostrichman" alt="ostrichman" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2087/2131536352_eed4992ac0_o.jpg" />And oh my, it seems one of my favorite attractions of the stage, Sidney Barnes the Human Ostrich, has expired in New Orleans.&nbsp; After complaining of stomach pains, the <em>Homo Struthio </em>underwent an operation to remove a cigar box full of bolts, carpet tacks, razor blades, washers and nails from therein&mdash;Barnes did not emerge alive.&nbsp; Guess <a title="burmashave" target="_blank" href="https://1947project.com/?p=2135">growing up</a> to be a carnival side can be rough, kids!</p>

<p>And what do have we here&hellip;a Coroner&rsquo;s inquest will be held at 1:30 today to determine whether Ralph McCoy, in City Jail on suspicion of robbery, actually hung himself in his cell or was killed by fellow prisoners&mdash;it seems McCoy bears (well, bore) a resemblance to one <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/10605329@N07/" target="_blank" title="WEH">William Edward Hickman</a>.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.&nbsp; Hickman.&nbsp; Some mention in the paper about him, too.</p>

<div>December 6, 1927<br />Los Angeles</p>
<p>Calling all cars! Calling all cars! Be on the lookout for two easily-recognized scofflaws, film stars Reginald Denny and Hedda Hopper. She&#8217;s wanted for speeding at about 34mph around Melrose and La Brea, he for setting a similar pace in the 20mph zone at Sunset and Vine, and without a valid operator&#8217;s license, on November 28. </p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not all! Denny is also wanted for questioning in the origins of the massive forest fire which began near his cabin near Running Springs Park in the San Bernardino Mountains two nights ago, and which hundreds of men are fighting, with 50 to 75 summer cabins already destroyed.</p>
<p>What shall we do with these antisocial celebrities? Perhaps we should just drop by their homes and have a talk with them. Miss Hopper is reported as residing at 1416 Fairfax Avenue, Mr. Denny at 2060 North Vine.</p>

Kill! Kill!</em>, Chase starred in <em>Nurse to You!</em>, <em>Okay Toots!</em>, <em>You Said a Hatful!</em>, <em>What a Bozo!</em>, <em>Skip the Maloo!</em>, and of course <em>&iexcl;Huye, Faldas!</em>, to name but a few.&nbsp; He also asked the cinematic questions <em>Are Brunettes Safe?</em> and <em>Is Everybody Happy?</em> and <em>Isn&rsquo;t Life Terrible?</em> and <em>What Price Goofy?</em> and <em>Is Marriage the Bunk?</em> and <em>Should Husbands Be Watched?</em> and <em>Why Go Home?</em> and while these aren&rsquo;t exactly <em>What</em> <em>Ever Happened to Baby Jane?</em> or <em>Who&rsquo;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</em> (or <em>What&rsquo;s the Matter With Helen?</em> or <em>Who Ever Slew Auntie Roo?</em> for that matter) they sure beat the stuffing out of <em>Where&rsquo;s Poppa?</em> and <em>What&rsquo;s So Bad About Feeling Good?</em> </p>
<p>Anyway.&nbsp; The judge should have thrown the book at Chase for his whisky-sippin&rsquo;, because his alcoholism killed him at the age of 47, in 1940.&nbsp; But then, what was Judge Baird to do?&nbsp; Send Chase to meetings?&nbsp; <a title="billw" target="_blank" href="http://www.moderndrunkardmagazine.com/issues/01-05/0105-dry-piper.htm">Bill Wilson</a> wouldn&rsquo;t get hot flashes for another seven years.</p>

<p>Car dealer R.C. Kane thought he was about to close a sale, and perhaps was leaning back with an air of satisfaction when the would-be buyer, Mrs. R.N. Upton, became startled at an intersection as another car approached. </p>
<p>She went for the brake, but hit the gas, and the car careened into Judge F.W. Houser&#8217;s yard and smacked into a concrete post. Kane and Upton, in the front seats, both went through the windshield and were severely cut and lacerated. In the back, Kane&#8217;s wife went out the window, and like Dwight Lesley was cut and bruised. The car was wrecked: NO SALE!</p>
<p>The victims were sent to Alhambra Hospital for treatment&mdash;all save Mrs. Upton, who insisted on seeing a Christian Science practitioner. <br /><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/535855962/"><img loading="lazy" width="399" height="305" border="0" alt="grace coolidge with pet raccoon rebecca, 1923" src="//farm1.static.flickr.com/251/535855962_04fadd0d04_o.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., President and Mrs. Coolidge&#8217;s pet raccoon Rebecca, a beloved pardon case from the White House larder one Thanksgiving, escaped and led staff on a two hour spree around the trees of the temporary White House, before climbing down and nonchalantly returning to her stump behind the residence. For more about the Coolidge&#8217;s interesting pets, see <a href="http://www.davidpietrusza.com/coolidge-pets.html" target="_blank">this article</a>, with much on Rebecca towards the end.</p>

<div>May 24, 1927<br />Los Angeles</p>
<p><em>Whoo-Whoo!</em> Get outta the road, here comes a cop, or an ambulance. Jeez, usually they drive better than that. This guy doesn&#8217;t give an inch. Muscling his way south through heavy Vermont Avenue traffic after midnight in his Essex, he pushes through the Third, Sixth and Seventh intersections with only some shattered nerves and shouted curses. </p>
<p>By this point he&#8217;s picked up a tail, Detective Lieutenant Vanaken riding with Auto Club man Harry Raymond, who wonder what the deuce this yutz thinks he&#8217;s doing, and if this could be the same siren-happy individual who&#8217;s been reported around town these past three weeks. And then at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=wilshire+and+vermont,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=55.937499,101.425781&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.063326,-118.291533&#038;spn=0.007235,0.012381&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">Wilshire</a>, the inevitable sickening crash of metal on metal, leaving A.J. Hanker and cabbie Oscar Ruiz, thankfully uninjured, sitting in their wrecked cars as Vanaken forces the automotive bully to the curb a block south. </p>
<p>Inside, Dr. R.B. King, 25, X-ray technician out Alhambra way, who denies causing the accident, though he admits he used his siren while not on an official call. Well, since he&#8217;s a doctor, they book King on charges of failing to stop and render aid at an accident scene, and hold him in the City Jail. Meanwhile, we trust, police mechanics are cutting that siren off the Essex, and none to carefully, either.</div>

<p>W. F. Linder is an unfortunate man.&nbsp; To begin with, he crashed his car.&nbsp; Into another car.&nbsp; Driven by a lawyer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>That other-car-drivin&rsquo; Los Angeles attorney, J. Irving McKenna, sued Linder for $12,000 ($142,542USD 2007) in damages.&nbsp; That was Wednesday.&nbsp; Today, two more damage suits were brought&mdash;seems passenger Mrs. Catherine McKenna is <em>also</em> a lawyer, and is counsel for her husband, who appears as <em>her</em> attorney; she demands $20,000 ($237,570USD 2007).&nbsp; Oh, yes, and Anna C. McKenna, another member of the family, is <em>also</em> demanding $20,000, and aforementioned Catherine is as well asking for $300 in medical expenses and $5000 in loss of earnings. </p>
<p>Drive carefully, folks. &nbsp;</p>
