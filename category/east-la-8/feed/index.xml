<p>February 18, 1927 <br />Whittier </p>
<p>The Whittier social set was agog at the forcible bobbing of Mrs. Evelyn Thompson&rsquo;s hair by two of her former friends, Mrs.&nbsp;Florence Nutt&nbsp;and Mrs.&nbsp;Lucille Roulston. </p>
<p>All three young women had married men in the local oil business. The couples had become friends who frequently partied together. At a recent dance,&nbsp;Lucille believed that Evelyn had spent too much time in the arms of her husband, and in a fit of jealousy she plotted her revenge. </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="Bobbed Hair Babes" height="320" alt="Bobbed Hair Babes" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2091/2275555284_7a2b5539d0.jpg" width="500" border="0" /></p>
<p>The bobbing incident unfolded like this: Evelyn had been out shopping for stockings, and as she passed by Roulston&rsquo;s home she was flagged down and invited inside to see Lucille&rsquo;s new hat. </p>
<p>Once inside the house, Evelyn decided to try on her new stockings. She was seated in a chair with one of her shoes off when she heard a snip and saw four of her curls fall to the floor. It was at this point that Florence held her down while the scissors wielding&nbsp;Lucille hacked off the rest of Evelyn&rsquo;s curls, snarling &ldquo;You used to be the center of attraction, but no man will ever look at you now.&rdquo; Evelyn told police &ldquo;It was over almost before I knew what was happening. I started fighting them without avail.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Prior to the forced shearing, Evelyn had sported lovely long chestnut curls &ndash; they were her crowing glory. She said &ldquo;I had never wanted to be a flapper. That&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t bob my hair.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Florence&nbsp;Nutt was arrested and charged with mayhem. A warrant had to be&nbsp;issued for the arrest of Mrs. Roulston, because she&rsquo;d taken it on the <a title="lam" href="https://www.answers.com/topic/lam" target="_blank">lam</a>. She was sighted in places as far flung as the Orient! </p>
<p>The mayhem charges would be dismissed, thus ending the criminal case. Evelyn had the option to seek damages in civil court if she wanted, but there would be no further mention of the bobbers or bobbee in the LA Times. </p>

<p>Family annihilator <a href="https://laurajames.typepad.com/clews/2005/08/if_ever_a_man_d.html" target="_blank">George Hassell</a> was convicted of killing his wife and her eight children by his late brother, and has an appointment with the Texas executioner shortly. While awaiting his last date, George recalled the wife he killed in Whittier in 1917 and the three children he buried with her beneath their little home at 236 South Whittier Avenue. There seemed no reason not to confess this, so today, with some direction from long-suspicious neighbor Myrtle Lark and a little more from the agreeable killer, Constable Bob Way crawled under the house and unearthed the body of an infant. Its mother and siblings soon followed, thus explaining the wretched odors that had long plagued the spot.</p>
<p>In slightly gayer news, the grand new Mayfair Hotel has opened in the Crown Hill district of Los Angeles, providing the ideal vantage point for a drunken oil company exec named Ray Chandler to hole up for days with his secretary while threatening suicide to all who&#8217;ll listen.</p>

<p>In a moment of clarity, Frank suggested officers talk to his sister-in-law Mrs. Jack Sweeney at 101 South Bunker Hill Avenue (a now lost street, one tail of which <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=N+Bunker+Hill+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+Los+Angeles,+California+90012,+United+States&#038;sll=34.030932,-118.206496&#038;sspn=0.008162,0.013733&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;cd=2&#038;geocode=0,34.062890,-118.244470&#038;ll=34.064499,-118.243961&#038;spn=0.008159,0.013733&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">remains</a>). The lady promptly admitted that Frank had been over the night before and had said unpleasant things about her, whereupon her Jack knocked him into the stove. Why yes, he had suffered head injuries in the fracas. But gee, a skull fracture? He must have gotten that after he left.</p>
<p>Entirely possible, of course. Bunker Hill&#8217;s not known as the Historic Skull Fracture District for nothing!</div>

<p>July 23, 1927 <br />Los Angeles </p>
<p>Detective Lieutenants Kallmeyer, Werne, and Roberts spent all day searching for the three contemptible men who cruelly drove away from a hit-and-run accident which left nineteen year old Aristo Santelanto of <a target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=712+Clara+Street,+Los+Angeles&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=42.445866,74.707031&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.057282,-118.231752&#038;spn=0.01088,0.018239&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=cent&#038;om=1" title="712 Clara Street">712 Clara Street</a>, dead at the scene. </p>
<p>The hardworking Santelanto was with a crew of men repairing railway tracks at <a target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=washington+and+cimarron,+Los++Angeles,+CA&#038;sll=34.09799,-118.331&#038;sspn=0.010874,0.018239&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" title="Washington and Cimarron">Washington Street and Cimarron Avenue</a> when an automobile that was traveling at approximately sixty miles an hour struck him. Without slowing, the death car sped away. </p>
<p>A sharp eyed witness to the crime furnished detectives with numbers from the car&rsquo;s license plate. The investigation was complicated because the crime car had traded hands several times over a period of six months. Undeterred, the cops persisted in their search and as a result, A.T. House, 32, of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Hollywood,_California" title="North Hollywood">Lankershim</a> (now North Hollywood), was handcuffed and taken into custody for suspicion of manslaughter. </p>
<p>House&rsquo;s passengers, Eugene Long, 20, and Paul Post, 32, both of Lankershim, were picked up by police at <a target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=sunset+and+wilcox,+Hollywood,+CA&#038;sll=34.13588,-118.3512&#038;sspn=1.391269,2.334595&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" title="Sunset and Wilcox">Sunset Boulevard and Wilcox Street</a>, where they were employed.&nbsp; The two men were taken to the City Jail and charged with failure to render aid.</div>

<p>June 12, 1927<br />Los Angeles  </p>
<p>Is there anything more quaint than a peanut wagon, its operator on life&rsquo;s downward slope yet cheerfully awaiting only a word from you to scoop up a paper sack of delicious, salty goobers? This was the face that 72-year-old Victor Tartas presented to the world&mdash;-until recently.   </p>
<p>To the untrained eye, the steady stream of customers at the peanut stand bore testimony only to the elderly Tartas&rsquo;s business acumen and pleasant personality. But Sergeant Adams of the Los Angeles Police Department detected something peculiar in the peanut vendor&rsquo;s manner:  if an approaching customer whistled once, Tartas responded with a single blast of the peanut cart&rsquo;s horn. Two whistles were met with two toots on the horn. A quick investigation revealed several pints of whiskey nestled beneath a false bottom in the wagon.   </p>
<p>Despite evidence to the contrary (twenty gallons of moonshine, a small still and a &ldquo;quantity&rdquo; of mash were found at the peanut vendor&rsquo;s home at <a title="The peanut vendor's home." target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=2118+brooklyn+avenue,+los+angeles,+california&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=57.162571,97.03125&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.043948,-118.19139&#038;spn=0.014793,0.023689&#038;z=15&#038;iwloc=cent&#038;om=1">2118-1/2 Brooklyn Avenue)</a>, Tartas pleaded not guilty. Jury trial was set for September 13, 1927. Bail was fixed at $1,000&#8211;which, it must be stated, wasn&rsquo;t peanuts.    </p>

<p>April 2, 1927<br />Los Angeles</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="248" height="298" border="0" align="left" title="tonyheadline" alt="tonyheadline" src="//farm1.static.flickr.com/191/443123163_016750b56f_o.gif" />On this Spring day in 1927, investigating officers were pavement-pounding in the Italian neighborhoods, attempting to scare up information about the April Fool&rsquo;s Day discovery of one murdered Antonio (Tony) Ferraro.&nbsp; But there was no talking to be had, and the crime scene revealed nothing in the way of tell-tale fingerprints or any such evidence, and so Tony Ferraro remains another unsolved Los Angeles gangland slaying.</p>
<p>Tony Ferraro was 34, married, and an erstwhile bootlegger.&nbsp; He had given up the bootlegging game back in January when officers knocked out his elaborate still at <a title="sotobootlegging" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=532+S+Soto+St,+Los+Angeles,+California+90033&#038;layer=&#038;sll=34.038791,-118.213105&#038;sspn=0.008855,0.020664&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=16&#038;ll=34.038791,-118.213105&#038;spn=0.008855,0.020664&#038;om=1&#038;iwloc=addr">532 South Soto St</a>.&nbsp; Thereafter he had gone into the olive oil business&#8211;the evening of March 31 he set out from his home at <a title="ferraroshome" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=2724+Cincinnati+St,+Los+Angeles,+Los+Angeles,+California+90033,+United+States&#038;layer=&#038;sll=34.046081,-118.20317&#038;sspn=0.008854,0.020664&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=16&#038;ll=34.046081,-118.20317&#038;spn=0.008854,0.020664&#038;om=1&#038;iwloc=addr">2724 Cincinnati St.</a> with six one-gallon cans of the unctuous stuff (only to return for his funeral a week later).&nbsp; On the morning of April 1 a passerby&rsquo;s attention was attracted by the stream of blood pouring forth from the back seat of Ferraro&rsquo;s Studebaker, parked at <a title="ferrarobodydump" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=659+Kohler+St,+Los+Angeles,+California+90021&#038;layer=&#038;sll=34.038329,-118.241837&#038;sspn=0.008855,0.020664&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=17&#038;ll=34.038196,-118.241837&#038;spn=0.004428,0.010332&#038;om=1&#038;iwloc=addr">659 Kohler St</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="356" height="400" border="0" align="right" title="ferraroandwife" alt="ferraroandwife" src="//farm1.static.flickr.com/159/444243163_855f37d0eb_o.gif" />Robbery was not the motive, as Ferraro&rsquo;s diamond ring, watch, money clip and olive oil were unmolested.&nbsp; Persons unknown entered Ferraro&rsquo;s car, where he was beaten with a tire iron (his bruised hands indicating he put up a strong fight) and then shot in the head once with a .38 and twice with a .32.&nbsp; The body was then pulled from the front seat and lain across the olive oil in the back.</p>
<p>Ferraro was a <a title="matranga" target="_blank" href="https://www.onewal.com/w-matran.html">Matranga</a> relative and Los Angeles bootlegger who had had some problems with his business partners.&nbsp; In September of 1925, someone dynamited a vacant two-story building Ferraro owned at <a title="building" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=2729+N+Main+St,+Los+Angeles,+Los+Angeles,+California+90031,+United+States&#038;layer=&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;sll=34.038196,-118.241837&#038;sspn=0.008855,0.013626&#038;z=16&#038;ll=34.066294,-118.213792&#038;spn=0.008852,0.020664&#038;om=1&#038;iwloc=addr">2729 North Main</a>; eight months later the home of his cousin, Victor Pepitone, <a title="pepitoneexplosion" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=317+w+77th,+la,+ca&#038;sll=34.066294,-118.213792&#038;sspn=0.008852,0.020664&#038;layer=&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=16&#038;ll=33.970129,-118.278637&#038;spn=0.008862,0.020664&#038;om=1&#038;iwloc=addr">317 West 77th St.</a>, was dynamited; five months thereafter the home of Jim Mussacci, Ferraro&rsquo;s business partner, <a title="675lamar" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=675+Lamar+St,+Los+Angeles,+Los+Angeles,+California+90031,+United+States&#038;layer=&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;sll=33.970129,-118.278637&#038;sspn=0.017724,0.027251&#038;z=16&#038;ll=34.065636,-118.223104&#038;spn=0.008852,0.020664&#038;om=1&#038;iwloc=addr">675 Lamar St.</a>, was destroyed in a dynamite explosion.&nbsp; The news from April 2 hints that Ferraro may have recently talked to authorities and implicated two former liquor trade associates, resulting in their arrest, but that clue went nowhere.&nbsp; Attempts to quiz the widow Constance resulted in her continued protestations that Tony had no enemies anywhere.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="350" height="227" border="0" align="left" title="ferraroscar" alt="ferraroscar" src="//farm1.static.flickr.com/228/444289097_9f1767f950_o.gif" />On April 5 the Times reported a rumor that Ferraro&rsquo;s car had been seen the night of the 31st in <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&#038;hl=en&#038;saddr=2724+Cincinnati+St,+Los+Angeles,+California+90033&#038;daddr=800+N+Alameda+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90012+to:659+kohler,+la,+ca&#038;mrcr=0,1&#038;layer=&#038;sll=34.040569,-118.222504&#038;sspn=0.035419,0.054502&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=14&#038;ll=34.047753,-118.222504&#038;spn=0.035416,0.054502&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="ferrarosride">Chinatown between when he set off from home at 6 p.m. and when the car was first spotted at 10 p.m. at Sixth and Kohler</a>, but placing the killing in Chinatown didn&rsquo;t make solving the murder any more possible or probable.&nbsp; That day Ferraro was released from the Coroner&rsquo;s to his home once more; the cinematic mind must imagine properly florid gangland sendoff, with bouquets from those Wright Act violators Tony double-crossed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And up in heaven, the special cloud reserved for unsolved LA homicide victims&mdash;Harry Katz there waiting with a martini&mdash;added one more.</p>
