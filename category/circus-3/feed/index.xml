<p>December 22, 1927<br />Los Angeles</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put up our feet and see what&rsquo;s gone on in the world this day.&nbsp; Not much.&nbsp; The odd curiosity or two.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><img loading="lazy" width="249" height="195" border="0" align="right" title="hemp" alt="hemp" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2197/2131536350_30713e4032_o.jpg" /><br />According to our concerned friends at the paper, it seems the Mexicans are making a menace of themselves, using flowers of the &ldquo;hemp&rdquo; plant as some sort of habit-forming drug (they&rsquo;re such a resourceful people!).&nbsp; Apparently the Imperial Linen Products Company has blanketed the Imperial Valley with the stuff.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;m sure the <a title="nexttheredcar" target="_blank" href="https://www.world-mysteries.com/marijuana1.htm">State</a> will sort this one out to everybody&rsquo;s satisfaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="253" height="200" border="0" align="left" title="onelastcig" alt="onelastcig" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2236/2131536354_cd46111e8d_o.jpg" />Oh dear, here&rsquo;s <a title="kaboom" target="_blank" href="https://pensive-torvalds-020d34.netlify.app/?p=2189">another</a> fellow who just couldn&rsquo;t resist a final cigarette.&nbsp; Seems J. B. Smith left the wife at his <a title="jbsHouse" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=420+west+maple,+glendale,+ca&#038;sll=34.291509,-118.432102&#038;sspn=0.016062,0.029182&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.138662,-118.261557&#038;spn=0.008045,0.014591&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1">Glendale home</a> and checked into the LaViolette Hotel on <a title="kablooie" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=N+Maclay+Ave,+San+Fernando,+Los+Angeles,+California,+United+States&#038;sll=34.28393,-118.43869&#038;sspn=0.008031,0.014591&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;cd=1&#038;geocode=0,34.290020,-118.432120&#038;ll=34.291509,-118.432102&#038;spn=0.016062,0.029182&#038;z=15&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1">North Maclay</a> in San Fernando.&nbsp; He brought with him a stack of goodbye letters indicating his fears about going mad, and a loaf of bread&mdash;not for snacking, but for soaking in water and wadding into the wafty windows and drafty doors (my hat off again to the resourcefulness of our Southlanders).&nbsp; Of course, no-one banks on the dang&rsquo;d jets taking so <em>long</em>.&nbsp; Thankfully J. B. also brought along a pack of <a title="ifyagotem" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIN8MmMloZE">smokes</a> to pass the time&hellip;the hole blown in the wall was six feet in diameter.&nbsp; J. B.&#8217;s smoldering remains lived long enough to say goodbye to his wife at the hospital, but not much longer than that.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="233" height="149" border="0" align="right" title="ostrichman" alt="ostrichman" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2087/2131536352_eed4992ac0_o.jpg" />And oh my, it seems one of my favorite attractions of the stage, Sidney Barnes the Human Ostrich, has expired in New Orleans.&nbsp; After complaining of stomach pains, the <em>Homo Struthio </em>underwent an operation to remove a cigar box full of bolts, carpet tacks, razor blades, washers and nails from therein&mdash;Barnes did not emerge alive.&nbsp; Guess <a title="burmashave" target="_blank" href="https://pensive-torvalds-020d34.netlify.app/?p=2135">growing up</a> to be a carnival side can be rough, kids!</p>

<p>And what do have we here&hellip;a Coroner&rsquo;s inquest will be held at 1:30 today to determine whether Ralph McCoy, in City Jail on suspicion of robbery, actually hung himself in his cell or was killed by fellow prisoners&mdash;it seems McCoy bears (well, bore) a resemblance to one <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/10605329@N07/" target="_blank" title="WEH">William Edward Hickman</a>.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.&nbsp; Hickman.&nbsp; Some mention in the paper about him, too.</p>

<p>August 3, 1927 </p>
<p>On this slow news day, readers of the Los Angeles Times were treated to a pair of interesting stories on page A8. The first was a five paragraph reprint from American Druggist magazine introducing Ben D. Rinehart, acting pharmacist for the Ringling-Barnum &amp; Bailey circus. You probably never stopped to think that a 600-pound fat lady might need three times the normal dose for a sleeping potion to work, but Ben has. He&#8217;s also proud of his rickets treatments for elephants, who consume quarts of cod liver oil and are wrapped in bandages the size of bedsheets.</p>
<p>More whimsical still was the piece entitled &quot;How To Walk On Air.&quot; How, you ask? Why, via that new and enervating sport of Balloon Jumping, as proposed in The Forum Magazine. Just grab hold of a big balloon with just slightly less lift than your weight and LEAP, over buildings, lakes and elephants with rickets! Mr. (wait for it) Frederick S. Hoppin is convinced that we&#8217;re at the outset of an age of shoulder-mounted gaspacks when everyone will have the ability to gambol about bearing just a portion of their natural weight. &quot;Our whole present-day world would be turned upside-down. Legislatures will be busily engaged in passing laws prohibiting people from leaving the earth too freely, or rules for the right of way up and down and sideways, or regulations against landing on the head of a fellow citizen or planting a foot on any part of him as you rise. And then there would be the new rule of etiquette: should you pass over or around a lady?&quot;</p>
<p>All right, class: discuss.&nbsp;  </p>

<p>September 25, 1907<br />Los Angeles&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ringling tents went &ldquo;dry&rdquo; today as Restaurant Inspector Schwegel turned whole tubfuls of pink lemonade into the sewer.&nbsp; He told the circusfolk that while the lemonade might do for an aquarium, it wasn&rsquo;t fit for human consumption.&nbsp; The lemonade booth was too near the animals, Schwegel said, and that besides the fleas and putrescent gunk within, it appeared to be contaminated with clothing dye.</p>
<p>City Chemist Miller added that the average circus lemonade is about as healthful as wood alcohol.</p>
<p>Something to remember next time you journey to the big top, or out to the County Fair (&lsquo;til October 1st!).</p>
