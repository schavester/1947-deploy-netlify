<p>December 29, 1927<br />Everywhere</p>
<p>Over there in Paris, noted astrologer and seer Professor Pav has pronounced that as years go, 1927 will pretty much be our last.&nbsp; Pav&rsquo;s millenarianistic prognostication has it all:&nbsp; Biblical foretelling, global warming (in this case, cooling), even the sky falling.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to spoil the ending, but we may just come out of this all kinder and gentler.&nbsp; Uh-huh. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The end of the world is imminent, but the globe will not be totally destroyed,&rdquo; said Pav the Prof.&nbsp; &ldquo;The <a title="thanksalotLeo" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_(constellation)">constellation Lion</a>, from the effect of some unknown force, will explode.&nbsp; A tremendous noise will be heard all over the world.&nbsp; Multitudes of stars composing the <a title="fabulous" target="_blank" href="http://sheepcrib.blogspot.com/2007/10/eschatology-world-ended-in-1928.html">Fubulae</a> will smash and a rain of falling stars will be visible in the sky.<br />&ldquo;An immense block, like a gigantic meteorite, <a title="uhoh" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKXX6Fwxk1Y&#038;feature=related">will fall</a> on the earth.&nbsp; The rupture of the planetary equilibrium will not cause disaster to the entire system, but the same night a bitter cold wave will be felt, and in the morning there will be ice and snow, although the catastrophe is due to occur in summer.<br />&ldquo;A large number of people will die in all corners of the globe, crops will be frozen and famine will conclude the hecatomb.<br />&ldquo;The most terrible part will be the falling on the earth of a colossal meteorite.&nbsp; The earth itself will be jolted from its orbit by the shock, but a magnetic force will prevent it falling and colliding with another planet.&nbsp; Large areas of land will disappear and new continents will appear.<br />&ldquo;At the end of the cataclysm only a relatively few people will survive.<br />&ldquo;Afterward nature will resume her task and man will become wiser and more tender.&nbsp; <a title="damndirtybolides" target="_blank" href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=VUR-OdR3egU">The bases of the present civilization will not be destroyed entirely</a>.&nbsp; The survivors will create a new social system, based on the respect of human life and confraternity.<br />&ldquo;All <a title="doooomed" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr6A6l8bWac&#038;feature=related">holy scriptures</a> and writings point to the year 1928 as being marked with the year 1928 as being marked with a special sign.&nbsp; It is possible that, owing to changes in the calendars during the centuries, there is a discrepancy, but the catastrophe will certainly happen during a summer night.<br />&ldquo;Savants will be able to warn us in advance of the approach of the <a title="bolidesof1928" target="_blank" href="https://pensive-torvalds-020d34.netlify.app/?p=1798">bolide</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Speaking of savants, interestingly, 1920s Scottish pyramidologist and <a title="NoahtheBrit" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Israelism">BI</a> posterboy <a title="plansbyEnoch" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Great-Pyramid-Its-Divine-Message/dp/1564591166">David Davidson</a> posited the Beginning Of The End would commence in 1928; he then foresaw the Great Depression, and World War II, and a &ldquo;union of Britain and America&rdquo; in 1947-8 [must&rsquo;ve had something to do with the Arab-Israeli Conflict].&nbsp; Oh yeah, and he predicted that the &ldquo;millennial reign of righteousness&rdquo; would begin on September 17, 2001.&nbsp; Well, close enough.)<br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>Was Los Angeles nearly ground zero for a Cretaceous-tertiary extinction event-styled piece of catastrophism?&nbsp; Sort of.&nbsp; Not really.</p>
<p>An asteroid nearly reached the open field near the home of Joseph Phillis, at the corner of <a href="http://maps.yahoo.com/;_ylc=X3oDMTExNmIycG51BF9TAzI3MTYxNDkEc2VjA2ZwLWJ1dHRvbgRzbGsDbGluaw--#mvt=m&#038;q1=MCCOLLUM+PL+AT+BERKELEY+AVE%2C+Los+Angeles%2C+CA%2C+90026&#038;trf=0&#038;lon=-118.266084&#038;lat=34.0862&#038;mag=3" target="_blank" title="mccullom">McCullom and Berkeley</a> early this morning.&nbsp; It exploded just before impact, leaving a burned patch twelve feet in diameter.&nbsp; The neighborhood was filled with heavy sulphurous smoke, in the center of which burned a dim blue flame.</p>
<p>Surrounding homes were rocked by the loud explosion and lit up by a Fourth of July spectacular, but the only extant remains of our spacejectile the shaken denizens could find were chunks of meteorite that resembled volcanic rock.</p>
<p>Otherwise neighbors, and dinosaurs, were not affected.</p>
