<p>June 9, 1927<br />Hollywood</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="252" height="290" border="0" align="right" title="brandingstory" alt="brandingstory" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1064/536837858_44e00aff99_o.gif" />Readers may remember <a title="lionattack!" target="_blank" href="https://pensive-torvalds-020d34.netlify.app/?p=1954">this</a> recent post about an animal-mauled Hollywood boardtreader.&nbsp; Now, encounter another actor attacked by beast&mdash;just as Bela Lugosi would one day meet a Brooklyn gorilla, 21 year-old actress Doris Williams (known on the stage as Doris Dore) has met her own New Yorker.</p>
<p>The anthropoidal New Yorker in question, all simian of structure and with &ldquo;arms like a gorilla,&quot; broke in and attacked Doris this morning at her <a title="Doris'place" target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=1924+Argyle+Ave,+90068&#038;sll=34.105837,-118.325222&#038;sspn=0.004086,0.007296&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.106777,-118.325222&#038;spn=0.008173,0.014591&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1">1924 North Argyle</a> apartment, who when she fought back, began slashing at her.&nbsp; She fainted, and awoke in a pool of blood, to find the prehuman had carved seven examples of the letter &ldquo;K&rdquo; on her person.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="296" height="500" border="0" align="middle" title="Ms.Doris" alt="Ms.Doris" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1205/536837860_99c0a3c540_o.gif" /></p>
<p>Doris met this preadamite character at a wild party in New York, where he forced her to sign some sort of &ldquo;mysterious paper.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Missingus Linkus then followed Doris across the continent, annoying her with threats and anonymous letters.</p>
<p>Doris had come to out West to portray Hester &ldquo;Pregnant Out of Wedlock&rdquo; Griffiths in Dreiser&rsquo;s &ldquo;American &lsquo;Filthy Bedroom Scene&rsquo; Tragedy&rdquo; in its Hollywood premier at the sunarc-laden January 17 grand opening of the <a title="WilkesVine" target="_blank" href="http://cinematreasures.org/theater/9863/">Wilkes&rsquo; Vine Theatre</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="260" height="290" border="0" align="left" title="stumpspolice" alt="stumpspolice" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1187/536837850_6b01d383ba_o.gif" />Which she did, her monkey-man close at heel, and after the show ended, knocked around and did whatever it is young ladies do in Hollywood.&nbsp; Captain of Detectives Slaughter has been busy trying to piece the events of the evening of June 8/early morning of June 9 together:&nbsp; Doris had been out with two married men (now sought for questioning), drinking it up at a local Italian place&mdash;she admitted to &ldquo;feeling pretty good&rdquo; when she returned but denied that these gents came back to her apartment with her&mdash;although other residents had complained to building manager Mrs. A. C. Black that they were disturbed by the loud noise and laughter emanating from within.&nbsp; Doris&rsquo; neighbor describes that later, she heard Doris telephone in a local Western Union call:&nbsp; &ldquo;Come on over in a hurry.&nbsp; Door unlocked.&rdquo;&nbsp; Said neighbor then recounts assorted door slammings, water runnings, medicine cabinet openings, and:&nbsp; &ldquo;I heard her put down the folding bed.&nbsp; I next heard her walk out of her apartment and go down the stairs and open the front door.&nbsp; A few minutes later I heard her running very fast back to her apartment.&nbsp; Within a short time I heard a man talking with her.&nbsp; His voice sounded to me like he was angry with her.&nbsp; They remained there for a while and finally went out together.&nbsp; I went back to sleep.&rdquo;<img loading="lazy" width="360" height="231" border="0" align="left" title="argyle" alt="argyle" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1089/536837848_ebedee5265_o.gif" /></p>

<p>(Above, Doris&#8217; apartment building, top center, across from the Castle Argyle.) </p>
<p>All grist for Detective Slaughter&rsquo;s mill&mdash;the only thing lacking being corroborative evidence regarding Doris&rsquo; New York Gorilla story.&nbsp; Compounding Slaughter&rsquo;s doubts thereof is information received from Doris&rsquo; friend George Lamont, who told detectives that last week, out-of-work Doris wished to arrange some daring publicity stunt (which George had sagely advised against).</p>
<p>Despite his misgivings, Detective Slaughter declared &ldquo;We are giving Miss Williams the benefit of the doubt until it is proven otherwise.&nbsp; If she was attacked as she says she was we will do everything within our power to bring the guilty party to justice.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p>It is of course not our place to judge whether she was in fact visited by a penknife-wielding primate from the Empire State, or this was a case of Morton Downey swastika prefiguration.&nbsp; Rather, we will leave it to our able readers to gaze at Ms. Williams&rsquo; visage and discern for themselves probable likelihoods.</p>
