<p>And so after nearly a week of extraordinary events, last night&#8217;s cocktail party, screening, gallery tour and crime scene tour spelled the end of the Lost Weekend. We were very fortunate to have photographer Meeno Peluce and his assistant Adam on hand to document the glamorous celebrants and festivities at the Biltmore, Laemmle Grand, Regent Galleries and aboard the Crime Bus. </p>
<p>Many thanks to all who turned out to be a part of these happenings, to remember Elizabeth Short and reflect upon why her story continues to resonate so strongly and so widely. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Below you will find a smattering of images from Meeno&#8217;s January 16th gallery, with many more to be seen <a href="http://www.meenophoto.com/dahlianight/" target="_blank">here</a>. Bye-bye, Dahlia, until next year&#8230;</p>

<div>The 60th Anniversary Lost Weekend of the Black Dahlia is nearly upon us, and we have two new events to announce.</p>
<p>On Friday, January 12, from 6-9pm, a woman dressed as the Black Dahlia will glide eerily along Hollywood Boulevard between Argyle and Cherokee, the old stomping grounds of Elizabeth Short. Perhaps she will be found in the Frolic Room or Pig and Whistle, or just cruising the boulevard. This spectral figure carries a basket of flowers, and will give one to anyone who calls her by her true name, Elizabeth. One of these lucky flowers is valid as one free ticket on the Sunday morning January 14 Real Black Dahlia Crime Bus Tour, or for half off one seat on the VIP midnight tour and film premiere on Tuesday January 16.</p>
<p>And on Thursday, January 11 at 9pm, a candlelit vigil will leave Regent Galleries, 446-450 South Main Street downtown, site of the Black Dahlia-inspired art exhibition &quot;Her Name Was Elizabeth.&quot; Those wishing to show their respect for Elizabeth Short and other souls lost to violence will walk from Main Street to the Biltmore Hotel, the last place she was seen alive, then continue south for a few blocks along the route that police believe she took before being abducted. The vigil will be led by Kim Cooper and Nathan Marsak, hosts of 1947project&#8217;s Real Black Dahlia Crime Bus Tour, and true facts and myths of the case will be shared along the way. The group<br />will then return to Regent Galleries for a 10:30pm screening of Ramzi Abed&#8217;s &quot;Black Dahlia Movie.&quot;</p>
<p>The Lost Weekend is six days of art exhibitions, readings, film screenings, live cabaret and Crime Bus tours celebrating the life, myth and legend of Elizabeth Short, The Black Dahlia. For a full schedule, visit <a href="http://myspace.com/thelostweekendlosangeles" target="_blank">http://myspace.com/thelostweekendlosangeles<br /></a><br />We have some openings on the Saturday 1/13 Real Black Dahlia tour. To reserve your seat on Saturday, Sunday 1/14 or the Tuesday 1/16 VIP night, please visit <a href="http://www.dumplinglab.com/crimebus" target="_self">http://www.dumplinglab.com/crimebus</a></div>
