<p> March 25, 1927<br />Los Angeles  </p>
<p>C. D. Fabrick had just stepped into the <a href="https://maps.yahoo.com/;_ylc=X3oDMTExNmIycG51BF9TAzI3MTYxNDkEc2VjA2ZwLWJ1dHRvbgRzbGsDbGluaw--#mvt=m&#038;q1=jefferson+at+san+pedro%2C+la%2C+ca&#038;trf=0&#038;lon=-118.265312&#038;lat=34.015335&#038;mag=3" target="_blank" title="jeffersonsanpedro">Jefferson and San Pedro</a> office of the Merchants&rsquo; National Trust and Savings Bank to begin his canvass of the theft and burglary situation in that part of the city.  Therefore he thought there was a gag afoot when a booted Olde West cowboy type approached him, twirling a gun.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a robbery and theft insurance underwriter,&rdquo; said Fabrick, &ldquo;what are you trying to do, kid me?&rdquo;  But Fabrick was not the butt of a joke but on the business end of a .45.  </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="127" height="220" border="0" align="left" title="blaisdell" alt="blaisdell" src="//farm1.static.flickr.com/167/433974872_4b0f4fec78_o.gif" />Fabrick, bank employees and customers were invited in thick Texas drawl to find themselves &ldquo;a nice cozy spot on the floor&rdquo; after which another bandit scooped $2,000 ($23,390 USD 2007) from the tills.  They then lumbered out to a dust-covered touring car where a third bandit sat with a Winchester rifle across his knees.  As the two egressed, one of the bandits held the door for an incoming customer and with true Texas courtesy drawled &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, lady.  It&rsquo;s all right.  Walk right in.&rdquo;  </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />While bank manager R. E. Blaisdell was not in attendance for the show, he had been present for an east side Merchants&rsquo; bank shootout earlier in the year that left one policeman and one bandit dead. </p>
