<p>August 20, 1927 <br />Malibu </p>
<p>In this case &ldquo;A Good Man is Hard to Find&rdquo; is not a reference to <a title="Flannery O'Connor" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flannery_O'Connor" target="_blank">Flannery O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s</a> allegorical tale of good and evil, faith and redemption &ndash; no, we are talking about finding a good man, one who won&rsquo;t desert his date on a quiet stretch of highway at the first sign of trouble, escorting her safely to her home instead. </p>
<p>Thelda Gollett, of <a title="456 Westminster" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=456+Westminster+Street,+Los+Angeles,+CA&#038;sll=34.064872,-118.303957&#038;sspn=0.011128,0.019677&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.065548,-118.319793&#038;spn=0.011127,0.019677&#038;t=h&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">456 Westminster Avenue</a>, and Arthur Israel of <a title="756 South San Pedro" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=756+South+San+Pedro,+Los+Angeles,+CA&#038;sll=34.065548,-118.319793&#038;sspn=0.011127,0.019677&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.039325,-118.248167&#038;spn=0.011131,0.019677&#038;t=k&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">756 1/2&nbsp;South San Pedro Street</a>, were taking a relaxing drive in the <a title="Los Flores" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=Los+Flores+Canyon+Road,+Los+Angeles,+CA&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=43.393645,80.595703&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.05386,-118.6405&#038;spn=0.178064,0.314827&#038;t=h&#038;z=12&#038;om=1" target="_blank">Los Flores Canyon</a> area when a man stepped out onto the roadway waving a revolver, and ordered them to stop. Upon seeing the bandit Thelda jumped from the car and started to run, with the gun wielding crook only a few yards behind her. </p>
<p>Rather than stay and protect his date, Arthur spun his car around and screeched off in the direction of Los Angeles. </p>
<p>Arthur wouldn&rsquo;t learn of Thelda&rsquo;s fate until after she had returned home unscathed. She reported to police that she hidden beneath a bridge until the highwayman disappeared. Once the coast was clear she was rescued by a passing truck &ndash; driven by a good man. </p>
<p>We suspect that this was the couple&rsquo;s last date. Maybe Thelda will keep company with that chivalrous truck driver. </p>
