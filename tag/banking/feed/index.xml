<p>April 3, 1927<br />America&nbsp;</p>
<p>The world is changing, sometimes for better, others for worse. In Chicago, the Western State Bank has responded to the concerns of its late night poker playing constituency by installing an ingenious device in the wall of their newest branch. This gadget permits an account holder to relieve himself of his attractive burden by way of a secure &quot;cash chute,&quot; a heavily armored tube alarmed with electrical and radio wave protection, thus protecting his winnings from street thug or wife alike. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>But in the nation&#8217;s capitol, the baggage handlers of the Union (Station) Transfer Company are crying poverty, blaming the flimsiness of fashionable ladies garb for the reduction in trunks being shipped ahead. Why, travelers simply stuff their wardrobes into suitcases and pack them in their cars! Accordingly, UTC is requesting permission to apply a rate increase to those sad saps who didn&#8217;t get the suitcase memo&#8230; but while they can gouge their customers, they can&#8217;t hold back the sands of time.&nbsp;</p>
