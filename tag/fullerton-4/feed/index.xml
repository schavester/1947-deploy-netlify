<p>In March of 1926 Alice&#8217;s husband M. J. Hanmore, a Fullerton oil worker, began experiencing stomach pains and loss of appetite; Drs. Claude E. Steen, Emerald J. Steen and John A.

<p>(Our evangelical docs Steen &amp; Steen will make the papers again in March, charged of malpractice by one Mary A.

<p>October 6, 1927<br />Fullerton</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only because of a kind fate which guards the lives of children at play was Virginia Mae Pike, two and one-half years of age, alive today&hellip;&rdquo; &hellip;or so reads the lead from this story.&nbsp; Oh sure, that&rsquo;s <em>got</em> to be it, it&rsquo;s all thanks to some rather specialized application of Fortuna Primegenia. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Seems Mr. and Mrs. George Pike tented their home at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=365+W+Truslow+Ave,+Fullerton,+CA+92832&#038;sll=33.868064,-117.931516&#038;sspn=0.008018,0.014591&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=33.868064,-117.931516&#038;spn=0.008018,0.014591&#038;t=k&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="thehomeonTruslow">365 West Truslow Avenue</a>, into which fumigators pumped pure cyanide gas.&nbsp; According to the medical experts, two breaths of the lethal fumes would kill a grown man, and here Virginia Mae stood erect in the stuff for <em>two minutes</em>.&nbsp; There she was, inside the tent, still upright but unconscious, when they pulled her out, gave her some mouth to mouth, and off she went.</p>
<p>There are only four possible explanations:</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;you cannot kill what is already dead; therefore, she is a zombie.&nbsp; She will eventually chomp on her parents, who will in turn infect others&mdash;this should probably be dealt with.&nbsp; Unfortunately for the Pikes, decapitation remains the best proven method for dealing with a zombie.</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;she is wampyear.&nbsp; Or vompyure.&nbsp; Or however one spells &ldquo;vampire&rdquo; to make it phonetically accurate.&nbsp; This should also be dealt with.&nbsp; Again, traditional methods apply.</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she is a suprahuman.&nbsp; Virginia Mae should be spirited away to a secret military base to breed an army of bioresistant super-soldiers, of course.</p>
<p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Pikes hired crummy fumigators. &nbsp;</p>
<p>At least these are more probable explanations than the kindly consort of some damn Moiraes, #4 certainly so should you shave down the argument with Occam&rsquo;s razor.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="263" border="0" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2035/1500077105_01e8e225d4_o.gif" alt="KarenCooper1927" title="KarenCooper1927" /></p>
<p>But don&#8217;t say we didn&#8217;t warn you.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="body">
<div>May 7, 1907<br />
Fullerton</p>
<p>Constable Edwards has a bulldog that his children have been playing with for two years.  A neighbor&#8217;s child was over a few days ago and was bitten on the arm.  Instead of taking responsibility for raising a beastly child that doesn&#8217;t know not to torment dogs, the evil neighbor requested of City officials that the dog be killed.</p>
<p>The City Marshall went to the home of Mr. Edwards and rightfully requested that Mr. Edwards be more careful with the dog in the future, while the neighbor still held that the dog be killed.  The Marshall departed but the neighbor kept at it, and dog owner Edwards finally consented to have the dog murdered.</p>
<p>The neighbor walked the dog down the Fullerton railroad tracks and shot him.  The dog rolled over and after a few minutes stopped kicking.  The neighbor returned to town and reported that the deed was done. </p>
<p>That night in the Edwards home the mantle clock ticked in earnest in its dreadful march to midnight when, moments before it chimed twelve, there was a scraping at the door.  Mrs. Edwards opened it.  &#8220;Is this the ghost of the dog or am I dreaming,&#8221; she said to herself.  Mr. Edwards rubbed his eyes and nearly toppled over as he joined his shocked wife in watching the dog crawl toward them&#8211;coming slowly forward&#8211;until as the dog shook his head a ball fell from his jaw.  Mr. Edwards says the dog will live.  Hopefully it will finish off that family next door.</p>
