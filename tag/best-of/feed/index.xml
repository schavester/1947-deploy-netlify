<p>We&#8217;re very happy to announce that the best of issue of the <a href="http://www.downtownnews.com/articles/2007/07/23/news/news04.txt" target="_blank">Downtown News</a> is on the stands, and Esotouric has been named Best Tours. </p>
<blockquote><p>In 2005, Kim Cooper, Larry Harnisch and Nathan Marsak created the 1947project, a blog that chronicled a different L.A. crime for each day of that year. The project was such a success that they followed up with a similar blog detailing the sordid affairs of 1907 and 1927. Now, Cooper and others lead excursions for a tour bus company called Esotouric. The four- or five-hour adventures canvass the city, highlighting crime sites from the heinous to the quirky. This summer, Esotouric debuted &quot;John Fante&#8217;s Dreams of Bunker Hill,&quot; which visited the Downtown haunts of Arturo Bandini, the protagonist of Fante&#8217;s 1939 novel <em>Ask the Dust.</em> In August, don&#8217;t miss the Charles Bukowski birthday tour, which celebrates what would have been the author&#8217;s 87th birthday. At esotouric.com<em>.-LL</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Well, if the Downtown News thinks we&#8217;re doing something right with our Black Dahlia, John Fante and other downtown-centered tours, the least we can do to say thanks is to offer two new bus tours celebrating the neighborhood as it was in the wild old days. </p>
<p>So on September 8, we&#8217;ll launch our first 90-minute Crime Bus tours, the back-to-back <a href="http://www.esotouric.com/hotelhorrors-sept8" target="_blank">Hotel Horrors</a> and <a href="http://www.esotouric.com/mainstreetvice-sept8" target="_blank">Main Street Vice</a>, with a cocktail/snack break between. You can ride one for $25 or both for $45, and we hope the lower price and shorter running time will be an opportunity for folks who&#8217;ve been wanting to ride for a while to join us. See you on the bus!</p>
