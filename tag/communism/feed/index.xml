<p>Those free love proponents are at it again!&nbsp; Everybody knows you should pay for love (with your soul).&nbsp; If we ran rampant with free love&mdash;divorced from the constraints of law&mdash;the next thing you know we&rsquo;d have homosexuality and obscenity and, well, divorce!&nbsp; And eventually&#8230;hippies!&nbsp; And, you know, free love!&nbsp; And you know where <em>that</em> sort of thing leads.&nbsp; <em>Female sexual pleasure</em>.</p>
<p>In any event, it should come as no surprise that United World Communism has the United States as its target for the promulgation of Free Love.&nbsp; But fear not, as one lone woman stands stalwart against the Reds and their revolutionary sexuality:&nbsp; Mrs. B. L. Robinson, President of the Massachusetts Public Interests League, and wife of Prof. B. L. Robinson, professor of botany at Harvard University.&nbsp; She addressed members of the Women&rsquo;s Political Study Club of White Plains on the topic of &ldquo;Alien Propaganda in Our Colleges and Schools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Robinson denounced the radical groups Fellowship of Youth for Peace and the National Federation of Students, but saved her most vitriolic vitriol for that incendiary demagogue whose unholy mission it is to urge our children to use birth control:&nbsp; Bertrand Russell.&nbsp; Unbelievably, stated Mrs. Robinson, Russell&rsquo;s <em>What I Believe</em> was used in the freshman year English course in Smith College, and over 170 other schools, though the book condones both sex perversion and adultery (Mrs. Robinson was especially peeved with Smith College&rsquo;s &uuml;ber-lefty <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Elmer_Barnes" target="_blank" title="HEB">Harry Elmer Barnes</a> friendship with Russell and Barnes&#8217; gleeful, secular-humanist demoralizing of twentieth-century womanhood).</p>
<p>Of course, this is 1927, and Russell still hadn&rsquo;t made his big splash with his piece of 1929 agitprop <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=g4NgDwJ4adcC&#038;dq=%22marriage+and+morals%22&#038;pg=PP1&#038;ots=808aB63VWK&#038;sig=n79iJG4yBXdGEwTaLk_DXGJkHQA&#038;prev=http://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3D%2522marriage%2Band%2Bmorals%2522%26ie%3Dutf-8%26oe%3Dutf-8%26aq%3Dt%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26client%3Dfirefox-a&#038;sa=X&#038;oi=print&#038;ct=title&#038;cad=one-book-with-thumbnail#PPA1,M1" target="_blank" title="marriageandmorals"><em>Marriage and Morals</em></a>, in which he goes on about how young people can try out intercourse with each other if they so wish before (or without!) getting married&mdash;heck, use birth control and get divorced if you wanna!</p>
<p>Now Mrs. Robinson, though Russell was one of those evil lefty one-worlder internationalists (we still fight them to-day!), did you not realize that in discussing birth control he was speaking of population control in general and of preserving your very race, endangered species that it is, in particular?&nbsp; Surely you thought of that as you spoke to your crowd there in aptly-named White Plains: &nbsp;</p>
<div align="justify"><em>This policy may last some time, but in the end under it we shall have to give way&#8211;we are only putting off the evil day; the one real remedy is birth control, that is getting the people of the world to limit themselves to those numbers which they can keep upon their own soil&#8230; I do not see how we can hope permanently to be strong enough to keep the coloured races out; sooner or later they are bound to overflow, so the best we can do is to hope that those nations will see the wisdom of Birth Control&#8230;. We need a strong international authority.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ndash; &quot;Lecture by the Hon. Bertrand Russell&quot;, <em>Birth Control News</em>, December 1922</div>
<p>Oh, and by the way Mrs. Robinson, you haven&rsquo;t all that much to fear from Reds of the Russian variety.&nbsp; By the end of the 20s Stalin had quashed all the <a href="http://www.marxists.org/archive/kollonta/index.htm" target="_blank" title="kollontai">strides</a> made after the October Revolution; you&rsquo;ve much more to fear from the <a href="http://www.edwardcarpenter.net/" target="_blank" title="carpenter">English</a> and the <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/20715" target="_blank" title="emmaG">Lithuanians</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakae_Osugi" target="_blank" title="SOsugi">Japanese</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeleine_Pelletier" target="_blank" title="pelletier">French</a> and the <a href="http://www.wilhelmreichmuseum.org/biography.html" target="_blank" title="reichian">Germans</a> and the <a href="http://www.takver.com/history/harford.htm" target="_blank" title="lesbia">Australians</a>&#8230;</p>
