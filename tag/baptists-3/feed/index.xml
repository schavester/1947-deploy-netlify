<p>July 29, 1927<br />Long Beach</p>
<p>Reverend W. R. Hardy, pastor of the African Methodist Episcopal Church of Long Beach, had a little quarrel with one Joe Dianty, Montegrin bootblack, in front of Dianty&rsquo;s home at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=1225+Martin+Luther+King+Jr+Ave,+Long+Beach,+CA,+USA&#038;sll=33.796446,-118.180425&#038;sspn=0.00822,0.014591&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=33.781894,-118.180211&#038;spn=0.008222,0.014591&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="diantyhouse">1225 California Avenue</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="259" height="233" border="0" align="left" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1255/949077968_06d5f83557_o.gif" alt="diantyshouse" title="diantyshouse" />Of the two things a pastor can draw from his waistband&mdash;his bible or his revolver&mdash;Rev. Hardy elected to draw the latter.&nbsp; He shot Dianty in the abdomen, and when Dianty turned the other cheek (to run away) Hardy shot him again in the neck and shoulder.&nbsp; Dianty died on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>On October 13, Hardy is convicted of manslaughter after a week-long trial involving thirty witnesses for the prosecution and half that number for the defense; on October 27 he is given one to ten in San Quentin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, would that he have had the jawbone of an ass&#8230;</p>

March 5, 1907<br />
Los Angeles    </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What shall we do with Emma? SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gone off to New Mexico and married a Chinaman. Her horrified mother hopes to get the marriage annulled, but Emma is an independent-minded young lady.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">EmmaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mother, Mary Culver of Monrovia, says she will do everything she can to undo her daughterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s marriage to Frank Chew, whom The Times describes as Ã¢â‚¬Å“a sort of missionary revivalist,Ã¢â‚¬Â noting that Ã¢â‚¬Å“Miss Emma had longings to help the heathen herself.Ã¢â‚¬Â</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Chew asked Culver for permission to marry Emma, but Ã¢â‚¬Å“it was bluntly refused,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times says. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Emma had a mind of her own and her answer was Ã¢â‚¬Ëœyes,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ regardless of her motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wishes.Ã¢â‚¬Â </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Even worse, Chew could be an illegal immigrant and if heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deported, Emma says she will be willing to go to China with him. She made this vow, even though she was warned that Chew would sell her into white slavery as soon as he got her to China.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Emma isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the only one in trouble. Members of the Chinese Baptist Mission are equally furious, saying that Chew borrowed jewelry from members of the congregation under the pretense of defending himself against deportation when in fact he used the money for his elopement. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In August 1907, Emma sent a letter from Hong Kong to her family, saying that their fears were baseless and that she and her husband had opened a day school where they taught English. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The next year, Emma mailed a photograph of her students and tried to recruit more women to come to China. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ã¢â‚¬Å“With her husband, Frank Chew, she has established an English school which is attended by the sons of well-to-do, educated Chinese gentlemen. The Chews have prospered beyond their wildest dreams,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times says. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ã¢â‚¬Å“Every family in Hong Kong seems anxious to have its children learn English and the pupils themselves study the language eagerly.Ã¢â‚¬Â</p>

<span style="font-size: 100%;">Jan. 12, 1907<br />
</span><span style="font-size: 100%;">El Monte<br />
</span><span style="font-size: 100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size: 100%;">For half a century, the Baptist Church of El Monte and the MasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Lexington Lodge No. 104 shared a clapboard building on Main Street, the worshipers on the first floor and the Masons, as always, on the second.<br />
</span><span style="font-size: 100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size: 100%;">Then came the developers and the urge to grow.<br />
</span><span style="font-size: 100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size: 100%;">Ã¢â‚¬Å“Seized with the thrill of the new trolley boom, the lodge members are about to put up a new Masonic temple; the Baptists, who have shared quarters with the Masons of El Monte for more than 50 years, are also said to be ambitious for a new place,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times says.<br />
</span><span style="font-size: 100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size: 100%;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">Taking the original name of the settlement, the Masons founded Lexington Lodge in May 1853, making it one of the oldest in California, and sent for regalia that came around the Horn from the East. One of the early lodge members, Elkenna Parrish, can still be seen driving his buggy around El Monte, The Times says.</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lmharnisch.com/images/1907_0112B.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="//www.lmharnisch.com/images/1907_0112B.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />
<span style="font-size: 100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size: 100%;">The Baptists, meanwhile, built the first Baptist church south of the Tehachapi, using ox teams to haul lumber from San Bernardino. The Rev. J.C. Freyer arrived after a six-month journey from Alabama and was the first Baptist minister ordained in Southern California, The Times says.<br />
</span><span style="font-size: 100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size: 100%;">The Baptists had outgrown the structure, built in 1866, and wanted a new church, but the Masons refused to yield their half, so they purchased the building in 1906 in an attempt to save it. By the next year, however, they agreed to let the small, old building come down.<br />
