<div align="left">Beverly Hills, CA&nbsp;</div>

<div><img loading="lazy" width="243" height="201" border="0" align="left" src="//farm1.static.flickr.com/227/496663071_c9f209004c.jpg" alt="rosabelleheadline" title="rosabelleheadline" />Rosabelle Laemmle, only daughter of Carl Sr., was arrested for speeding in Beverly Hills today.&nbsp; When Officer McBane asked where she was headed in such a big hurry on this Saturday night, she replied, &quot;To the dentist.&quot;&nbsp; Unfortunately for Rosabelle, she&#8217;d already used that excuse on McBane twice before.&nbsp; Tired of playing the chump, McBane said, &quot;I advise you to have all your teeth pulled out and to present this speeding ticket to Justice of the Peace Etrelinger on the 23rd.&quot;<img loading="lazy" width="92" height="240" border="0" align="right" src="//farm1.static.flickr.com/205/496663093_0269105597_m.jpg" alt="rosabellelaemmle" title="rosabellelaemmle" /> </p>
<p>While it&#8217;s tempting to call this story just another example of heiresses behaving badly, Rosabelle was really a fairly good egg.&nbsp;  After her mother&#8217;s death in 1918, Rosabelle, then a teenager, took over management of all household duties.&nbsp; As her father&#8217;s success grew, so did her responsibilities, and she became known in Los Angeles society as a terrific hostess.&nbsp; In her late teens, she flirted first with the idea of becoming an actress, and then with her father&#8217;s protege, Irving Thalberg.&nbsp; However, Rosabelle&#8217;s interest in the limelight eventually faded, as did the romance (Thalberg is thought to have left Universal, in part, because of this). </p></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Rosabelle wedded businessman Stanley Bergerman in 1929, settled down, and had two children.&nbsp; Presumably, her driving settled down as well.</div>
