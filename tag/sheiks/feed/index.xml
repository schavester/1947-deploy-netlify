<p>November 27, 1927<br />Los Angeles  </p>
<p>Did you hear the one about the traveling salesman and the farmer&#8217;s daughter? Well, this time she wasn&#8217;t a farmer&#8217;s daughter&mdash;and the salesman ended up dead. Eleven days ago, 17-year-old Marie Hull went for a ride with Gordon J. Waters, 29, the salesman in question. When she returned home to <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=840+West+43rd+Place,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=34.005232,-118.288121&#038;sspn=0.007524,0.011437&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.00589,-118.288186&#038;spn=0.007524,0.011437&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">840 West 43rd Place</a>, Marie tearfully told her mother that Waters had attacked her.   </p>
<p>When Hazel Hull discovered Waters at her boarding house tonight, presumably to call on Marie, she was ready. When the salesman left the house, Hull rushed after him and pressed a .38 caliber revolver to his left side. She fired a single shot, then fled to her mother&#8217;s. Waters staggered to the intersection of <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=hoover+street+and+vernon+avenue,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=34.00589,-118.288336&#038;sspn=0.007524,0.011437&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.005232,-118.288121&#038;spn=0.007524,0.011437&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">Hoover Street and Vernon Avenue</a>, where he collapsed. He died on the way to <a href="https://jpg1.lapl.org/pics48/00043770.jpg" target="_blank">Georgia Street Receiving Hospital</a> without making a statement.   </p>
<p>Days of juicy reading followed. Booked into <a href="https://jpg1.lapl.org/pics35/00037443.jpg" target="_blank">County Jail</a> prior to the coroner&#8217;s inquest, Hazel Hull told reporters, &quot;I am glad I killed him even though I hang for it. My little girl was sweet and good. I did the only thing I could to avenge her.&quot; Her ex-husband proclaimed his willingness to stand by his former wife&#8217;s side, and Marie asserted that if her mother &quot;had not shot him I would have done so myself.&quot;  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Waters&#8217;s widowed wife of six months (&quot;heavily veiled in a great pink chiffon drape that completely covered her head and shoulders,&quot; according to the <em>Times</em>) took issue with the Hulls&#8217; insistence that her husband had been &quot;a sheik&quot; and &quot;a rounder.&quot; She preferred to blame the other victim:  &quot;Marie Hull led my husband on. She knew he was married.&quot; This was a minority view, however; when the coroner&#8217;s jury announced their finding that Hazel Hull was justified in shooting her daughter&#8217;s attacker, applause broke out in the court room, and spectators rushed to shake Hull&#8217;s hand. The following day, Hull escaped a murder charge when the grand jury refused to indict her.  </p>
<p>Despite the column inches it devoted to the case, the <em>Times</em> editorialized that &quot;If Waters&#8217;s conduct was indefensible, there seems even less defense for that of Mrs. Hull&quot; and likened the juries&#8217; refusal to indict as an &quot;indorsement [<em>sic</em>] of lynch law.&quot;    </p>
