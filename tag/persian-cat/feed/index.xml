<p>August 27, 1927 <br />Hollywood </p>
<p>Future dwellers, don&rsquo;t think we can&rsquo;t see you smirking. This computational device works both ways you know. Drag your minds out of the gutter and we&rsquo;ll tell you a cute story about a girl and her&hellip;cat. </p>
<p>Lydia Dixon is a stage actress from New York with an unusual reason for coming to Hollywood &ndash; her 18 year old <a title="Persian Cat" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Cat" target="_blank">Persian cat</a>. The elderly white fluff ball was finding Gotham City winters too harsh, so when Lydia wrapped up a show on Broadway she made arrangements to vacation in Southern California with her favorite feline. </p>
<p>Lydia hadn&rsquo;t considered working here but after spending a short time enjoying our glorious climate she was<img loading="lazy" title="Wild Westcotts" height="120" alt="Wild Westcotts" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1235/1249003671_c22a30739e_o.jpg" width="275" align="right" border="0" /> delighted when she was asked to play a role in the stage comedy, &ldquo;The Wild Westcotts&rdquo;. She accepted the part and can currently be seen on stage at the Vine Street Theater. </p>
<p>Lydia has said that she sometimes gets homesick for New York, but until her cat breathes its last she plans to stay right here in Tinseltown. </p>
<p><em>See, we told you it was a cute story. Shame on you!</em> </p>
