<p><img loading="lazy" width="242" height="283" border="0" align="left" title="demerveux1" alt="demerveux1" src="//farm1.static.flickr.com/249/445310421_24227a8e39_o.jpg" />Today, fencing master and underwear salesman Lt. Gerard&nbsp; De Mereux was vindicated for the second time in the space of a week.&nbsp; Last week, De Mereux was awarded $500 in damages in a suit against Hollywood director J. Stuart Blackton, who was accused of beating De Mereux with a horsewhip.&nbsp; De Mereux had been living as a guest in Blackton&#8217;s home, giving fencing and corrective gymnastics lessons to Blackton&#8217;s daughters.</p>
<p>De Mereux testified that Mrs. Blackton had given him a romantic note, and that as a gentleman, &quot;the only honorable thing for him to do was leave.&quot;&nbsp; While packing his bags, Mrs. Blackton reportedly began to strike and spit at him, at which point, Blackton entered the room with a riding crop and beat De Mereux about the shoulders and chest. <img loading="lazy" width="122" height="240" border="0" align="right" title="demerveux2" alt="demerveux2" src="//farm1.static.flickr.com/234/445323451_2cf8f92d7b_m.jpg" /></p>
<p>Blackton testified that the attack was prompted by De Mereux&#8217;s attack on his wife, during which he choked her and clawed at her with his fingernails, drawing blood.&nbsp; But ho!&nbsp; De Mereux presented to the jury his fingernails, and brought forth numerous witnesses who claimed that De Mereux had spent the past 12 years as a confirmed nailbiter who could not possibly have scratched a soul. </p>
<p>Following the judgment, De Mereux was taken before the Lunacy Commission on an insanity complaint offered by Albert A. Kidder, Blackton&#8217;s attorney.&nbsp; After several days of observation, physicians from the Lunacy Commission declared him merely &quot;emotionally unstable,&quot; but were unable to find evidence of the insanity complaint, which, among other things claimed that De Mereux had threatened Blackton&#8217;s daughters.  </p>
