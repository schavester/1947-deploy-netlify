<div>February 8, 1927<br />Los Angeles</p>
<p>The fourth in a series of bold daylight robberies of outlying classrooms has been reported at the Lillian School, near <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=Holmes+and+Slauson+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+CA,+USA&#038;sll=33.99511,-118.230314&#038;sspn=0.026187,0.054159&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=33.990715,-118.241172&#038;spn=0.006547,0.01354&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=0" target="_blank">Holmes and Slauson Avenues</a>. As a room full of terrorized seven-year-olds covered their ears and quaked, a tall, very slender negro relieved their teacher, Mrs. Ruth Hanna, of her handbag, which contained $20 cash. His weapon was neither gun nor knife, but his horrifying facility with curse words and threats. The criminal is suspected to be one William Tyler, known to police as &quot;Stealing 24&quot; and &quot;The Apple Box Kid.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in darkest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Hollywood,_Los_Angeles,_California" target="_blank">Lankershim</a>, Isabel Suaze, 15, is in hiding after hearing her parents&#8217; plans for the family to return to their former home in Arizona. The girl is such a California booster, she&#8217;d rather become a street urchin than leave L.A. Here&#8217;s to a most discerning young lady!</div>
