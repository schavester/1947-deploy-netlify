<div align="left">Several west coast railroads launched their See America First campaign earlier this week, offering slashed rates to eastern destinations in an effort to equalize east-west travel during the busy summer months.&nbsp; However, the program got off to a rocky start when two of the first trains to leave Union Station collided early this morning, resulting in two fatalities and 165 injured persons.</p>
<p>The accident took place when a section of the Santa Fe Railroad&#8217;s California Limited line stopped on a downgrade to make a brake adjustment, and was plowed by another California Limited train just outside of Flagstaff, AZ.&nbsp; Sleeping passengers were rattled from their berths as cars were knocked off the rails.&nbsp; Mrs. Ernest Watson, the wife of a Hollywood firefighter, was pronounced dead at the scene of the accident, while dozens of other injured passengers and railroad employees were shuttled to nearby Mercy Hospital in Flagstaff. &nbsp;Twenty-five of the most seriously wounded were transferred back to Los Angeles. &nbsp;Two of them, Lee Evans, a dining car waiter, and Mrs. Robert L. Vivian, the wife of a retired minister, died en route.&nbsp; Or so it seemed, for the rumors of Evans&#8217;s demise were greatly exaggerated.&nbsp; A few days after his death was reported, he was found alive and more or less well.</p>
<p>An inquest by the Coroner&#8217;s jury in Flagstaff found evidence of negligence, but could not place blame conclusively. &nbsp;The jury recommended a full investigation to be carried out Arizona state officials.&nbsp; Arizona passed the buck to the Interstate Commerce Commission who, after a month-long investigation, found the engineer of the second trail negligent for failing to heed caution signals.&nbsp; Simmons was his name.</p></div>
