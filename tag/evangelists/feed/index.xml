<p>July 24, 1927<br /> Echo Park</p>
<p>Relations between evangelist <a href="https://www.npr.org/programs/lnfsound/stories/991126.stories.html">Aimee Semple McPherson</a> and her mother, Mrs. Minnie &quot;Ma&quot; Kennedy, are reported to be on the mend today after a recent dust-up concerning the management of McPherson&#8217;s <a href="https://jpg3.lapl.org/pics32/00065634.jpg">Angelus Temple</a>. Kennedy had been acting as business manager while Sister Aimee was off on a <a href="https://jpg3.lapl.org/pics10/00024620.jpg">preaching</a> tour, but a series of burglaries (whispers said embezzlements) caused some church members&mdash;her daughter apparently among them&mdash;to lose confidence in Kennedy&#8217;s abilities. Sister Aimee cut her trip short earlier this week and returned to Los Angeles, where yesterday she announced that her mother was going to take a &quot;long needed&quot; vacation to the Holy Land.  </p>
<p>Today, however, Sister Aimee presented her mother with three options by way of a peace pact. Mrs. Kennedy could either (1) remain at the church but not in a managerial position; (2) take control of the entire organization while Sister Aimee founded a new and separate church; or (3) retire from all active participation in the church and receive &quot;a substantial income from Angelus Temple&quot; for the rest of her life.   </p>
<p>Mrs. Kennedy declined comment (though reporters noted her tearful visage). It is anticipated she will choose the first option. Sister Aimee meanwhile emphatically denied any personal animosity between the women (<a href="https://jpg3.lapl.org/pics10/00024555.jpg">seen here</a> reunited, along with Aimee&#8217;s children, after last year&#8217;s <a href="https://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/la/scandals/aimee.html">&quot;kidnapping&quot;</a>) or even that anyone had tried to oust her mother from the church in the first place.   </p>
<p>In another blow to the scandal-plagued evangelist, former Angelus Temple band leader <a href="https://jpg3.lapl.org/pics04/00021680.jpg">Gladwyn Nichols</a> today announced his reasons for leaving McPhersons&#8217;s church to found his own, chief among them being Sister Aimee&#8217;s &quot;sensational&quot; alleged abduction of last May. Nichols also pointed to alleged financial improprieties at Angelus Temple, and condemned Sister Aimee&#8217;s &quot;flagrant &hellip; activities in obtaining publicity&quot; including &quot;posing before the news camera in stylish and expensive dresses&quot; and &quot;being photographed with bobbed hair.&quot;     </p>
