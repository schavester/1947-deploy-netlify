<div align="left">Los Angeles dance instructor Ernest E. Ryan has seen the future of dance, and it is the Kinkajou.</p>
<p>After attending the 1927 annual convention of the Dance Masters of America, Ryan told the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> that he expected a Kinkajou craze to overtake California by winter, and that he would be teaching the steps in his studio at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=1500+s.+figueroa,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=31.150864,82.265625&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.038934,-118.269496&#038;spn=0.007948,0.020084&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="figueroa">1500 S. Figueroa</a>.</p>
<p>The Kinkajou was created by Edna Passpae, inspired by a song and dance number from the 1927 Ziegfield musical <em>Rio Rita</em> that included the lyrics, &quot;When you do the Kinkajou, you dance before you think.&quot;&nbsp; She debuted it at the DMA convention where it won first prize, beating out new steps like the Dixie Stomp and the Lindbergh Glide.</p>
<p>It was said that the Kinkajou would &quot;be the dance to replace the Charleston and the <a href="https://www.streetswing.com/histmain/z3blkbtm.htm" target="_blank" title="blackbottom">Black Bottom</a>.&quot;&nbsp; Sadly, the Kinkajou&#8217;s moment in the sun was brief.&nbsp; <em>Rio Rita</em>, however, went on to become an <a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt0020332/" target="_blank" title="riorita">early talkie hit for RKO</a>, starring Bebe Daniels and John Boles, and marking the film debut of comedy team Wheeler and Woolsey. </div>
