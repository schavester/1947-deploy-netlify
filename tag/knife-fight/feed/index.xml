<div>April 28, 1907 </p>
<div>Los Angeles</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em>Tamalaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>That is the call of the tamalera, they known to those of us who reside in the Hispanic neighborhoods, a siren song that wakes us to church, to industry, but mostly to meat and masa in husk.&nbsp; But treat these folk well; James Couts, a sash and door worker playing a game of ball at 38<span>th</span> and Santa Fe yesterday, was knifed repeatedly by a tamale peddler after some trouble about payment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In other news, the rash of burglaries continues to increase as Fiesta nears.&nbsp; A. C. Nagle was brutally assaulted, and robbed of his diamond ring and Elks pin, at Ocean Park last night.&nbsp; Rings were stolen from 936 East 31<span>st</span>, and silverware and clothing from 210 East 16<span>th</span>.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Nearer town, in a restaurant on North Main Street, James Selagar and Pedro Fierros fought a furious knife duel, sending both, after their arrest, to Receiving Hospital for treatment.</div>
</div>
</div>
