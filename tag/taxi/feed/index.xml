<p>Anna Karrick, 22, ran away from her Illinois farm home to win fame in pictures, but found herself down and out. &nbsp;</p>
<p>At a dance, she met a nice guy, Phillip Linker, of <a title="linkersplace" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=1327+W+4th+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90017&#038;sll=34.057975,-118.260827&#038;sspn=0.007377,0.014591&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.057031,-118.260835&#038;spn=0.000922,0.001824&#038;z=19&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1">1327 West Fourth Street</a>.&nbsp; She persuaded him to come back to her <img loading="lazy" width="127" height="229" border="0" align="right" title="anna" alt="anna" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1288/1176331072_c1b71ab8d2_o.gif" />place at <a title="annasplace" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=532+S+Fremont+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+Los+Angeles,+California+90071,+United+States&#038;sll=34.057031,-118.260835&#038;sspn=0.000922,0.001824&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;cd=2&#038;ll=34.053388,-118.258445&#038;spn=0.007378,0.014591&#038;z=16&#038;om=1">532 South Fremont Avenue</a> (one imagines it didn&rsquo;t take all that much persuasion).&nbsp; Once there, in the hallway, thoughts of ingress dancing in Linker&rsquo;s head, he is brained by a rolling-pin, wielded by one Jess F. Waller.&nbsp; Linker wakes up in a taxicab, lightened of seven dollars and other valuables.</p>
<p>Waller and Karrick are thrown into County and charged with robbery and ADW.&nbsp; Anna told the court today about her relationship with Waller, sure, but denied knowing he&rsquo;d be there with her rolling-pin. </p>
<p>Sadly the Times didn&rsquo;t see the need to print the trial&rsquo;s outcome, and because there&rsquo;s no Anna Karrick listed in imdb, we must sadly assume she never broke through Hollywood&rsquo;s gates.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="314" border="0" align="left" title="532" alt="532" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1056/1176594125_47f11e68b0_o.gif" />532 South Fremont (now site of Glossy Black Tower, left) may be long gone, but it was a fun place while it lasted.&nbsp; In May 1929, Filipino nationals Cal Blanco and Ceferino Sandries argued over women with some sailors from the USS Colorado, when Blanco announced, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to kill all you sailors,&rdquo; and so sailor Clyde Forehand shot them both dead; July of 1929 saw a riot there involving thirty sailors and six women, at which two women and seven men were booked on suspicion of robbery; Jack Wilson and Clark Falcon, leaders of a gang of automobile plunderers, were arrested with their booty here in February, 1932; in September 1935 Robert Honchell, a 25 year-old taxi driver, was having a drinking party with his pal Edward Folder, a 29 year-old unemployed caf&eacute; worker, when a woman showed up with her infant daughter&mdash;Folder&rsquo;s insistence on taking the child out for candy started a quarrel, and Folder ended up stabbed mortally in the chest by Honchell&hellip;you get the idea.</p>
