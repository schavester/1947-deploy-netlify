<p>Seems the Clarks got a few in &lsquo;em and, sans hollow leg and all, the booze went to their collective head, and they thought it a good idea to hop in a flivver and go tearing down <a title="missionblvdriverside" target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=Mission+Boulevard,+Riverside,+Calif&#038;sll=34.032034,-118.469524&#038;sspn=0.015613,0.027809&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.025917,-117.448311&#038;spn=0.124913,0.222473&#038;z=12&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1">Mission Boulevard</a> here in Riverside.&nbsp; Despite the symbiosis that stems from years of wedded camaraderie, his stomping the gas while she pounded brake and clutch didn&rsquo;t work out to their combined advantage&#8230;no, these tourists from the Lone Star state plowed into another vehicle driven by one Fred Stutzman of West Riverside.</p>
<p>Deputy Sheriff Scott hauled the intoxicated unipeds off to the hoosegow, and reported that while both autos were severely damaged, no-one was seriously injured.&nbsp; Scott certainly realized that had someone involved lost a limb, he would have had to fill out the separate irony paperwork, instead of just checking the irony box on his standard report form.</p>

Los AngelesCheck the barometer: rising suicide, murder and drunkenness let us know there&#8217;s a good chance of 1907 to-day.Lena Rossester lived in a bungalow at 604 Vitmer with a younger man&#8211;some would say her son, but the gentleman won&#8217;t give his name and begs that Lena&#8217;s recent fatal carbolic cocktail be suppressed by the press (no such doing here!); D. Orlackey made a move to murder his family at 1021 E. 54th, but his wily wife locked him in the closet until authorities could arrive; and Thomas Dunn, of no fixed address, made a bed of the Hollywood Electric tracks until rudely awakened by the fender of a trolley that took a good chunk out of his head (he&#8217;ll be fine&#8211;nothing a visit to the oft-mentioned Receiving Hospital can&#8217;t fix).</p>
<p>Ah, the touchstones of our time.</p>
