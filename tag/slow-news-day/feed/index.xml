In the past two weeks, I&#8217;ve come to understand why Kim usually waits until Fridays to post her 1947p stories.  Ever since this leap year, I&#8217;ve found myself with the Sunday paper, which, while jam-packed with Bullock&#8217;s ads, real estate ventures, and fashion spreads (this week, an entire section devoted to shoes!), is rather short on crime and mayhem.  After all, who wants to dwell on such things on the Christian day of rest?
</p>
<p>
And after the stories of the past two days, perhaps there&#8217;s some sense in that.  Unable to top the likes of baby farms and superman love cults, I suppose it&#8217;s fair to say that I&#8217;m feeling a little blocked.

California fig laxative:Ã‚Â  it &quot;can&#8217;t harm children.&quot;Ã‚Â  If that&#8217;s not a ringing endorsement, I don&#8217;t know what is.

And take a look at this plug for Jewish boxing legend Lew Tendler, as he prepares for his upcoming bout.  Does the &quot;S&quot; stand for Southpaw or sexy?
