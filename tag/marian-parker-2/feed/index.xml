<div>December 25, 1927<br />
Pendleton, Oregon</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a blue Christmas for the family of Marian Parker this year, though they may take some pleasure in the knowledge that accused killer William E. Hickman tried to kill himself todayÃ¢â‚¬â€both times conveniently in front of a guard (Hickman was planning an insanity defense). The child murderer celebrated the holiday in a Pendleton, Oregon jail cell, prior to being transported back to Los Angeles for trial. Guards reported that Hickman roused himself from hours of lethargy by tearing pages from a bible and scattering them on the floor. He then asked for a handkerchief, and when his jailer obliged, quickly knotted it around his throat and pulled tight. The guard rushed into the cell, where Hickman climbed to the top of his bunk and attempted to dive headfirst to the concrete floor. The State of California  went on to accomplish what Hickman failed to on October 19, 1928.

<p>December 18, 1927 <br />Los Angeles  </p>
<p>This morning&#8217;s headline was set in the giant typeface reserved for only very good or very bad news. This time it was the latter:  &quot;Kidnaped [sic] Child Slain By Fiend.&quot; For three days now, Angelenos have followed the story of 12-year-old Marian Parker, lured away from Mount Vernon High School by a man who said her father was ill. The kidnapper demanded $1500 (close to $18,000 in 2007) for her safe return, and Marian&#8217;s father agreed to pay it.   </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lperil/2122206832/" title="The suitcase by peril61, on Flickr"><img loading="lazy" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2346/2122206832_5615e008d8.jpg" width="366" height="336" ALIGN="right" alt="The suitcase" /></a></p>
<p>Shortly after 8 o&#8217;clock last night, the kidnapper drove up to the agreed-upon meeting place. Marian&#8217;s small form was visible in the passenger seat. &quot;Here&#8217;s your child,&quot; he told Parker. &quot;Give me the money and follow instructions. She&#8217;s asleep now.&quot; The ransom changed hands; the criminal drove a short way and deposited Marian&#8217;s blanket-wrapped figure on the lawn at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=432+South+Manhattan+Place,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=66.457072,103.886719&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.06729,-118.310351&#038;spn=0.008674,0.012681&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="Where Marian's body was found">432 South Manhattan Place</a>. Perry Parker rushed to his daughter, scooped her up and&mdash;in a waking nightmare that must have haunted him for the rest of his days&mdash;discovered she was dead, her eyes wired or sewn open in a hideous simulacrum of life. A wire was bound so tightly around her neck that it cut deeply into her flesh; she had been disemboweled and her legs hacked off close to her body. The <em>Times</em> was filled with stories comparing the Parker case to Leopold and Loeb and a host of other grisly child murderers. Crowds of bloodthirsty thrill seekers (the <em>Times</em> estimated over 25,000) thronged past the Parker household at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=1631+South+Wilton+Place&#038;sll=34.06729,-118.310351&#038;sspn=0.008674,0.012681&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.043734,-118.314471&#038;spn=0.008677,0.012681&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="The Parker Family Home">1631 South Wilton Place</a> (address helpfully supplied by the paper).   </p>
<p>The horror continued today. While most of Los Angeles was still reading its morning papers, citizens aiding the police found five gruesome bundles on a lonely road in Elysian Park. The first contained Marian&#8217;s arms and legs; the last, found by &quot;two small boys, carrying on the search,&quot; held her viscera. A blood-soaked suitcase previously discovered in the gutter at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=620+South+Manhattan,+los+angeles&#038;sll=34.063397,-118.31033&#038;sspn=0.008675,0.012681&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.063877,-118.31033&#038;spn=0.008675,0.012681&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="Where the suitcase was found">620 South Manhattan</a> place is believed to have held the child&#8217;s body. Then, late this evening, the police found an abandoned Ford roadster, license number 667-67. It is believed to be the automobile driven by the kidnapper to the meeting with Marian&#8217;s father.   </p>
<p>A massive manhunt is underway for the <a href=" http://markgribben.com/?p=288">fiendish killer</a>.<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lperil/2121428979/" title="A &quot;Grisly Rendezvous of Death&quot; by peril61, on Flickr"><img loading="lazy" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2241/2121428979_34477caed6.jpg" width="500" height="224" alt="A &quot;Grisly Rendezvous of Death&quot;" /></a></a></div>
