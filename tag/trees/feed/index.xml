<p>Mrs. Nancy Parrish likes her palm tree.&nbsp; A lot.&nbsp; And who can blame her?&nbsp; This is Los Angeles.&nbsp; Palms define our city&mdash;in shape, in spirit, in soul.&nbsp; So when she looked out her window and saw someone digging up the palm in front of her home, <a title="courtst" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=West+Court+St,+90026&#038;sll=34.068729,-118.2622&#038;sspn=0.016424,0.029182&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.068196,-118.2622&#038;spn=0.016424,0.029182&#038;z=15&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1">419 Court Street</a>, she became enraged, and grabbed the 1927 version of pepper spray, a can of red pepper.&nbsp; She raced down the stairs and threw it full in the workers&rsquo; faces. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Never mind that it wasn&rsquo;t really her palm&mdash;Nancy&rsquo;s just a renter&mdash;she loved her palm, dammit.&nbsp; Of course that&rsquo;s no solace to poor Francisco Rodriquez, one of the diggers, who&rsquo;s facing the loss of his eyes, according to attendants at Receiving Hospital.&nbsp; Sidney Kanin, of 828 North Vermont, who&rsquo;d hired Rodriquez to help him dig out the palm, luckily turned his head in time to avoid the capsicum contents.&nbsp; Apparently Kanin had purchased the palm from Karl Vmorin, owner of Nancy&rsquo;s rentahouse. &nbsp;</p>
<p>After the attack, Kanin summoned policemen William Price and J. L. Willis to the scene, but they refused to arrest Mrs. Parrish; nosy neighbors are reporting that matter to Chief Davis.&nbsp; A complaint charging Parrish with battery and wrongful acts, and a warrant for her arrest, have since been issued by Chief Deputy City Prosecutor Concannon.</p>
