<p>Those of you who have taken a club to an elderly woman know, that&rsquo;s six months in County.&nbsp; Everybody knows that.&nbsp; And just as those of us who have wielded a pool cue at a mother-in-law are looking at the ol&rsquo; six mos and that $500 ($5,515 USD2007) fine, that&#8217;s what shoulda faced Anaheim&rsquo;s Walter J. Jewell&mdash;except in his case there were <em>extenuating circumstances</em>.</p>
<p>You see, he&rsquo;s a man who loves his children.&nbsp; He <em>wuvs</em> them.&nbsp; In that bloodlusty kinda way.</p>
<p>Seems that Jewell arrived at wifey&rsquo;s house (they&rsquo;re separated) to pick up the kids for the customary week-end visit.&nbsp; But despite his being a prominent citizen, he just doesn&rsquo;t see fit to pay his alimony, which sent wifey&rsquo;s mother&mdash;the aforementioned mother-in-law&mdash;into a huff.&nbsp; Crone in question, Mrs. Marion Blake, also of Anaheim, refused to allow Jewell possession of the youngsters.&nbsp; Enraged, Jewell rushed back to his auto and retrieved his trusty billiard cue.&nbsp; Back in the house he did, though, stop short at cracking her skull open like a soft-boiled egg. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The court informed Mrs. Blake that it was &ldquo;inadvisable&rdquo; to take the law into her own hands&mdash;that would be apparent.&nbsp; Mr. Jewell was scolded that he was &ldquo;old enough to know better&rdquo; than to &ldquo;assault an aged woman with a club.&rdquo;&nbsp; That may be.&nbsp; In any event, because everyone loves children so durn much, Judge Ames decided to knock Jewell&rsquo;s punishment down to ninety days and nix the fine.&nbsp; Awwwww.</p>

<p>July 18, 1907</p>
<p>Anaheim&nbsp;</p>
<p>One more tong war post, and then I&rsquo;ll return to our regularly scheduled horrors committed by, I don&rsquo;t know, Dutch people.  </p>
<p>Anaheim, California:  best known for Disneyland and the Pond, or, at least, known for the winemaking prowess of Victorian Bavarians, and having been run by the Klan in 1924.  And I&rsquo;d like to remind you that on this day in 1907, Anaheim was the scene of a particularly grisly murder.  </p>
<p>Mock Fat was an Anaheim vegetable salesman and a particularly card-carrying, dues-paying member of the Hop Sing.  But Anaheim is largely Bing Goon territory, and as such, the aged Fat a prime target.  </p>
<p>Classic tong style:  shot twice in the back, he fell on his face.  A knife was stabbed repeatedly into his back and left there.  Of course, a hatchet was used to cut up his head.    </p>
<p>As usual, the police have been dispatched to the train stations.  While imported highbinders are escaping detection by hiding out in downtown Japanese rooming houses, cops have nevertheless managed to nap Visalians Tai Choy and Lin Poon, implicated in the killing.   </p>
