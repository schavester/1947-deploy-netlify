<p>In an effort to redeem a luscious dairy treatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s good name after being caught in a <a href="/icecream">bootlegging scandal</a> last weekÃ¢â‚¬â€-or perhaps because it was a slow news dayÃ¢â‚¬â€-Dr. Frank McCoy today announced that Ã¢â‚¬Å“ICE CREAM IS A REAL FOOD.Ã¢â‚¬Â </p>
<p>This is the good news weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been waiting for, folks. According to Dr. McCoy (author of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Health and Diet AdviceÃ¢â‚¬Â column), ice cream Ã¢â‚¬Å“should at all times be considered a real food and not a delicacy.Ã¢â‚¬Â Besides being rich in vitamin A and calcium, a half-pint of ice cream has as much lime as a half-pound of butter, four pounds of meat, or three-and-a-half pounds of potatoes. Never heard about the importance of lime in your diet? Me eitherÃ¢â‚¬â€-but if we eat enough ice cream, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll never have to worry about it again. </p>
<p>Dr. McCoy also has a word or two for those who criticize manufacturers for adding gelatin to their ice creams. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ I would suggest that the laws be changed to admit the use of even more gelatin, as this is an excellent food product which makes the ice cream still more palatable and delicious.Ã¢â‚¬Â </p>
<p>Packed with all that lime and gelatin, ice cream is a veritable superfood. Dr. McCoy Ã¢â‚¬Å“suggest[s] that you try some summer lunches with ice cream as the principal part of the meal, using with it any one kind of the acid fruits Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ or Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ cooked and raw nonstarchy vegetables.Ã¢â‚¬Â Ice cream salad, anyone? </p>
<p>Should you find your pants getting a little tight after all that healthfulness, you might want to take a look at Dr. McCoyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book, <i>The Fast Way to Health</i>.

<div>I spoke with master gelato artiste Tai Kim today and confirmed that he will be making a special Black Dahlia gelato to honor the memory of murder victim Elizabeth Short and the mystery of her unsolved slaying. This flavor will debut on Friday 9/15, the day the movie of the same name is released, and will be available on a limited basis through Saturday 9/16. </p>
<p>Tai is still weighing the right ingredients for the flavor&#8211;we talked about squid ink, black sesame, tea, jasmine, tomato (Bloody Mary sorbet) and basil all being options. The flavor&#8217;s specifics will be nailed down in the next week or so, and I&#8217;m very curious to see what he does with it.</p>
<p>Scoops flavors sampled today: Chocolate Wasabi (great texture and color, very intense flavor), Olive Oil and Salt (sweet, savory and weirdly greasy, interesting but a sample spoon was the perfect size) and Arnold Palmer (soooo lemony, very refreshing).</p>
<p>The Real Black Dahlia Crime Bus Tour will stop at Scoops for a taste of the Black Dahlia as part of its route, at no additional charge. I&#8217;m  excited Tai was so open to collaborating, and happy to be able to introduce our passengers to his amazing shop.</p>
<p>Scoops is at 712 N. Heliotrope Dr., just north of Melrose, and is open Monday-Saturday, 12pm-9pm. </p></div>
