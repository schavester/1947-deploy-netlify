<p>May 3, 1927<br />Pomona&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some call it extortion; we call it a rather clever short con. C.L. Jackson and R.W. Hedgreth, both 48 and old enough to know better, approached service station operators Harold K. Hemmingway and Norman Bliss in the guise of being Prohibition officers, and asked where &#8217;round here one could wet one&#8217;s whistle. After being informed of the details, Jackson and Hedgreth threatened to alert the <em>real</em> Prohibition men of the illegal info being spread, and demanded a pair of tires, gasoline and $25 cash to keep quiet. But Hemmingway noted the serial numbers on the bills and called the law, and the crooks were soon nabbed.</p>
<p>Justice U.E. White must not have thought much of the victims in the case, for he sentenced the men to six months in County Jail, which he promptly suspended for good behavior.&nbsp;  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Reno, Nevada&#8217;s first short residency divorce was granted to Sophia M. Ross of New York, who braved the desert winds and cultural drought for three months so she could be freed of her Albert, who ate mashed potatoes with his hands. &nbsp;</p>
