<p>Today, after the usual morning argument in their <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=531+Westminster+Ave,+Alhambra,+CA+91803&#038;sll=34.088457,-118.156285&#038;sspn=0.008672,0.01399&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.088457,-118.156285&#038;spn=0.008672,0.01399&#038;z=16&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="thelovenest">Alhambra home</a>, George announced he&rsquo;d had his fill, and moved his stuff out to go shack up with&hellip;a <em>widow</em>.&nbsp; Tonight Mabel followed George to <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=335+W+42nd+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90037&#038;sll=34.007529,-118.279273&#038;sspn=0.001085,0.001749&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.008185,-118.279281&#038;spn=0.00868,0.01399&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="salyerhome">335+1/2 West 42nd Street</a>, where George was involved with one Mrs. Helen Salyer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Along for the ride Mabel had taken her old friend the pistol.</p>
<p>In fairness, Mabel did, on the sidewalk in front of Helen Salyer&rsquo;s house, give George one last chance, asking him to come back to her.&nbsp; George approached and said, firmly, no.&nbsp; With that, Mabel shot him in the stomach; the force of the blast turned him around and Mabel shot him again in the back.&nbsp; Mabel walked back to her car, got in, and sat calmly there until authorities arrived. &nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="143" height="263" border="0" align="right" title="helen" alt="helen" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2264/2190610901_cef07b0c4a_o.jpg" />Mabel was arrested by Detective Lieutenants Brown and Adams of University Station, who found her composed, and that she could only comment that if she couldn&rsquo;t live with him, no-one could.&nbsp; When asked if she felt any regret, she replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is a woman ever really sorry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(With no defense offered other than the &ldquo;unwritten law,&rdquo; on May 19 she was ordered held to Superior Court for trial by Municipal Judge Rosencranz on charges of assault with intent to commit murder.&nbsp; She told the court &ldquo;I shot him because I loved him&rdquo; and reiterated &ldquo;sure I shot him&mdash;if I couldn&rsquo;t live with him I wasn&rsquo;t going let anyone else live with him.&rdquo;&nbsp; The jury, out an hour, gave her a full acquittal on May 24.)</p>

<p>Von Falkenstein was apprehended after he came to have a peek at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=223+s.+mccadden+pl.,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=29.440076,59.765625&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.071715,-118.337195&#038;spn=0.007501,0.014591&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="mccaddenpl">223 S. McCadden Place</a>, a home that had recently gone on the market.&nbsp; There, he met real estate salesman H.H. Morgan, who did not get Fred&#8217;s name, but found him suspicious enough to jot down his license plate number as he drove away.&nbsp; When the house was later burgled, Morgan <img loading="lazy" width="137" height="240" border="0" align="right" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1416/1405743772_d2a49b61cb_m.jpg" alt="vonfalkenstein2" title="vonfalkenstein2" />handed the number over to police who confiscated between 6 and 8 carloads of stolen goods from Von Falkenstein&#8217;s home at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=619+meridian+ave.,+alhambra,+ca&#038;sll=34.071715,-118.337195&#038;sspn=0.007501,0.014591&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.088582,-118.15414&#038;spn=0.007499,0.014591&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="meridian">619 Meridian Avenue</a>.&nbsp; Found among the items were Oriental rugs, solid silver home accessories, a radio cabinet, and a French salon painting valued at approximately $5000 that he&#8217;d lifted from the art gallery at the <a href="https://jpg1.lapl.org/spnb01/00007150.jpg" target="_blank" title="ambassadorhotel">Ambassador Hotel</a>.</p>
<p>Though Von Falkenstein worked with an accomplice, Robert Donaldson of <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=1928+crenshaw,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=34.088582,-118.15414&#038;sspn=0.007499,0.014591&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.040783,-118.331165&#038;spn=0.007503,0.014591&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="crenshaw">1928 Crenshaw</a>, he acted alone in the art theft and said it was easy.&nbsp; He simply walked into the empty gallery, cut the canvas out of its frame, rolled it up, and walked out of the Ambassador without drawing any attention.</p>
<p>In addition to the art theft, Von Falkenstein also pled guilty to two more home burglaries, and was sentenced to 2 terms of 1 to 15 years at San Quentin.&nbsp; And so it was that our love bird turned jailbird.</p></div>

<div>June 8, 1927<br />Alhambra</p>
<p>Car dealer R.C. Kane thought he was about to close a sale, and perhaps was leaning back with an air of satisfaction when the would-be buyer, Mrs. R.N. Upton, became startled at an intersection as another car approached. </p>
<p>She went for the brake, but hit the gas, and the car careened into Judge F.W. Houser&#8217;s yard and smacked into a concrete post. Kane and Upton, in the front seats, both went through the windshield and were severely cut and lacerated. In the back, Kane&#8217;s wife went out the window, and like Dwight Lesley was cut and bruised. The car was wrecked: NO SALE!</p>
<p>The victims were sent to Alhambra Hospital for treatment&mdash;all save Mrs. Upton, who insisted on seeing a Christian Science practitioner. <br /><a title="Photo Sharing" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/535855962/"><img loading="lazy" width="399" height="305" border="0" alt="grace coolidge with pet raccoon rebecca, 1923" src="//farm1.static.flickr.com/251/535855962_04fadd0d04_o.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., President and Mrs. Coolidge&#8217;s pet raccoon Rebecca, a beloved pardon case from the White House larder one Thanksgiving, escaped and led staff on a two hour spree around the trees of the temporary White House, before climbing down and nonchalantly returning to her stump behind the residence. For more about the Coolidge&#8217;s interesting pets, see <a href="https://www.davidpietrusza.com/coolidge-pets.html" target="_blank">this article</a>, with much on Rebecca towards the end.</p>

<p>If there&#8217;s one thing we at 1947project love even more than uncovering<br />  evidence of an incredibly weird forgotten crime, it&#8217;s Chinese<br />  food&#8211;especially dumplings! Whether fried or boiled, stuffed with<br />  shrimp, pork, pumpkin, fish, scallions or sometimes a little dollop of<br />  soup, nothing is more comforting and delicious.</p>
<p>  With <strong>Blood &amp; Dumplings</strong>, we&#8217;re combining our favorite things to bring<br />  you the first new Crime Bus tour of 2007, a a grim and gleeful descent<br />  into the criminal history of the San Gabriel Valley, including the battling Nazis of El Monte, the chilling (and probably incestuous) Case of the Buried Bride, missing Salvador Dali paintings, the dark history of the Lions Club&#8217;s lion meat BBQs held in eye- and nose-range of hundreds of the lovely beasts, the Man from Mars Bandit (his mystery revealed!), plus Phil Spector, neglected Manson victim Steve Parent, Geneva Ellroy and a peculiar East L.A. link to the JFK assassination, concealed Black Panthers and the coolest trailer parks in the Southland.</p>
<p>Included in the $55 ticket price is a special stop for Chinese comfort food at one of the best dumpling joints in Monterey Park&nbsp; and an afternoon picnic surrounded by real sea monsters.</p>
<p>  Click <a href="https://crimebus.dumplingjoint.com/" target="_blank">here</a> to buy your ticket by paypal, or <a href="https://www.47upgradepath7.richardschave.com//feedback" target="_self">email</a> to reserve a seat that you will purchase with a money order or check.</p>
<p>We hope to see YOU on the Crime Bus!</p>
<p>your hosts,<br />Kim Cooper &amp; Richard Schave </p>
