<p>December 5, 1927</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="82" height="240" border="0" align="left" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2084/2088614830_626f01f052_m.jpg" alt="june" title="june" />Mr. and Mrs. Jack Laughlin of 2115 S. Harvard departed for a weekend getaway in San Diego, leaving their daughter, June Blossom, 14, in the care of their housekeeper and family friends.&nbsp; After saying goodbye to her folks, June invited her friend Mary Jane Carroll, 13, over for the weekend.</p>
<p>Sunday afternoon, the girls went outside to play, and vanished.&nbsp; Shortly after their disappearance was noticed, the blue dress and sandals that June had been wearing that day were found in a nearby vacant lot.&nbsp; When the Laughlins returned, they found that in addition to a missing daughter, about $4000 worth of clothing and tapestries were missing from their home.</p>
<p>So sinister-sounding were the facts surrounding the disappearance of Mary Jane, and June that it seems impossible that the incident wrapped up as happily as it did.&nbsp; As it turns out that the whole thing could be chalked up to a case of &quot;girls will be girls.&quot;<img loading="lazy" width="128" height="246" border="0" align="right" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2202/2087827349_fc008a23d1_m.jpg" alt="maryjane" title="maryjane" /></p>
<p>On December 6, Mr. Laughlin and Mr. Carroll set out to pick up their daughters from a San Diego hotel.&nbsp; The girls had skipped town on a lark with the intention of surprising June&#8217;s parents in San Diego.&nbsp; Unfortunately, they&#8217;d left around the same time that Mr. and Mrs. Laughlin had started home.</p>
<p>No word on how June&#8217;s clothes turned up in the lot, or the whereabouts of the missing tapestries; however, the most precious cargo was accounted for, albeit in deep, deep trouble.</p>
