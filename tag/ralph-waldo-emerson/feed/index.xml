<p>July 2, 1927 <br />Hollywood </p>
<p>&ldquo;Hitch your wagon to a star.&rdquo; &#8212; <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson" title="Emerson">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a><img loading="lazy" width="82" height="240" border="0" align="right" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1406/654754990_2021a58a2d_m.jpg" alt="Rose Host" title="Rose Host" /></p>
<p>A blue-bound copy of Emerson&rsquo;s essays, 50 cents, and the clothes on her back were all that Miss Rose Host had with her when she stowed away aboard the Panama Pacific liner &ldquo;Manchuria&rdquo; bound for Los Angeles. If Capt. William J. Munroe hadn&rsquo;t been so understanding and hadn&rsquo;t allowed her to earn her passage by stamping passenger forms for the ship&rsquo;s purser Leo Gallagher, she may never have made it. </p>
<p>Rose&rsquo;s picture appeared today in the Los Angeles Times accompanied by a story about her Hollywood dreams of gold and fame. A beauty contest winner in her home state of New York, Rose believes that a successful career in tinsel town is within her grasp. </p>
<p><em>Fast forward six months.</em> Rose landed a bit part in the film <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0018391/" title="Shootin Irons">&ldquo;Shootin&rsquo; Irons&rdquo;</a> with Jack <img loading="lazy" width="240" height="229" border="0" align="left" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1360/654754980_f76844dbc1_m.jpg" alt="Rose and Jack" title="Rose and Jack" />Luden. See &ndash; that&rsquo;s Rose in the photograph, nothing more than a silhouette. Her part was so small she wasn&rsquo;t even mentioned in the credits, and her Hollywood dreams ended with one picture. Rose Host the actress was not heard from again. </p>
<p>Maybe she became an English professor, sharing her love of Emerson with idealistic undergraduates. Let&rsquo;s hope so, because when a Hollywood dream becomes a nightmare you have <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0524859/" title="Jack Luden">Jack Luden&rsquo;s</a> story. </p>
<p>Jack and Rose were both in their 20s when they made &ldquo;Shootin&rsquo; Irons&rdquo; together. Jack was an heir to the Luden&rsquo;s cough drop fortune, but he was young and it was Hollywood so he tried his hand at acting. He was a handsome guy and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Studio" title="Paramount">Paramount</a> planned to feature him in westerns as they&rsquo;d done with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000011/" title="Gary Cooper">Gary Cooper</a>. Unfortunately for Jack, &ldquo;Shootin&rsquo; Irons&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t a success and by 1930 the studio had either dropped him or he&rsquo;d walked away from his contract to pursue a life as a junkie. </p>
<p>How he spent the years between 1930 and 1936 remains something of a mystery, but by the 1940s the thrice married Luden had a monkey on his back the size of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheeta" title="Cheeta">Cheeta</a> on steroids. He drifted in and out of the movie business &ndash; and trouble, for the next decade. </p>
<p>During those six lost years&nbsp;Jack evidently&nbsp;acquired a taste for the seamy side of life. Busted several times for shoplifting to support his heroin habit, he was known to have said &quot;a crooked buck is sweeter than an honest dollar.&quot; Jack, it seems, was an unrepentant sinner. </p>
<p>Finally in 1951 he was sent to <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_quentin" title="San Quentin">San Quentin</a> for drug possession and passing bad checks. Nine months into his sentence Jack dropped dead of a heart attack. He was 49.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Come on and try your luck <br />You could be Donald Duck <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooray_for_Hollywood" title="Hooray for Hollywood">Hooray for Hollywood</a>!&rdquo; <br />&#8212; Johnny Mercer </p>
