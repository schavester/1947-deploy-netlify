<p>November 15, 1927<br />Los Angeles</p>
<p>All around town, the news is notable.</p>
<p>Off in Owensmouth (Canoga Park to you crazy modernists), the citizens complain there are so many stray dogs in the streets, it&#8217;s worse than Constantinople. Consider the deep valley as your next exotic vacation spot.</p>
<p>Mrs. Andria Reyes, 34, has eleven children and a husband who won&#8217;t work, and they all have the munchies. That&#8217;s more or less the excuse she gave Judge Westover for her small marijuana farming operation.</p>
<p>1120 East 32nd Street was burning, and Mrs. Frankie Weaver, 64, escaped unharmed. But once on the street, she realized she&#8217;d forgotten her canary Dickey. Back into the flaming second floor she charged, only to fall back, burned, inconsolable, without her little pet. They found her on the neighbors&#8217; porch, badly injured but unaware of herself, gazing mournfully into the fire, and took her to Georgia Street for treatment.</p>
<p>And in Wahperton, North Dakota, comes the passing of Hans Langseth, who had not cut his beard since July 14, 1875. It measured 17 feet when he breathed his last, and he could not only wear it round his neck like a muffler (mmm, sexy!), but traveled the world as a circus exhibition and won the 1922 world&#8217;s longest competition at the Days of &#8217;49 celebration in Sacramento. We hear these things grow posthumously, so let&#8217;s call Hans&#8217; crowning glory 17 feet, 1 inch. Huzzah!</p>
