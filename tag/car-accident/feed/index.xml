<p>March 14, 1907 </p>
<p>Los Angeles   </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="150" height="252" border="0" align="left" src="//static.flickr.com/56/112675425_b3abeb1e2f_o.jpg" />Pity Miss Jane Beamer of Long Beach, who for most of her 20 years has yearned to meet her father, from whom her mother separated when she was tiny, back in Beamerville, IL. </p>
<p>She has discovered to her great grief that the fruit and confectionary vendor killed Tuesday night near his shop at <a target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=708+East+Fifth+Street,+Los+Angeles,+CA&#038;ll=34.043557,-118.241944&#038;spn=0.015326,0.04004">708 East Fifth Street</a> was this same Frank O. Beamer, who has been living in this community for a number of years. Many times had Jane Beamer, her mother and her step-father R.E. Blair passed Beamer&#8217;s stand, and even gazed into his face, without recognize the ladies&#8217; kinsman, who was also Blair&#8217;s schoolyard chum. </p>
<p>Today, Miss Beamer grieves at the Bresee Brothers&#8217; mortuary on South Figueroa Street, lending comfort to Beamer&#8217;s widow, who did not know until today of her husband&#8217;s previous marriage or child. </p>
<p>The accident occured when Beamer stepped off an East-bound Brooklyn Avenue streetcar at the intersection of Fifth and Ruth Avenue. As he alit, his path was crossed by an automobile driven by W.P. Young, carrying three ladies and R.H. Ingram, general superintendent of the Southern Pacific Railroad, en route to catch the San Francisco Owl train at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=S+Alameda+St+%26+E+4th+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90013&#038;ll=34.044054,-118.238125&#038;spn=0.015326,0.04004" target="_blank">Arcade Depot</a>. </p>
<p>Beamer, who was very nearsighted, was apparently startled to see the machine so near him, and moved first one way, then another, before dashing headlong into the path of the oncoming auto. Although Young killed his engine and attempted to swerve, Beamer was struck and killed where he stood. </p>
<p>The inquest found Young without fault after Beamer died in the Emergency Hospital without regaining consciousness.</p>
