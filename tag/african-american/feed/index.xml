<p>Archie Quinzey appeared as his own defense today before Superior Judge Stephens, on the charge of unlawfully entering a local home, proceeding to the cupboard, and gorging himself on the comestibles therein. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Normally, it is said, he who is his own lawyer has a fool for a client, but such was not the case with Mr. Quinzey.&nbsp; Stephens heard and considered Quinzey&rsquo;s plea, glanced out the window at a restaurant, considered and cogitated a spell, and stated that while he could impose a heavier sentence, he would not, and felt that a mere six months in County would teach Quinzey to ignore the savory odors emanating from other persons&rsquo; kitchens.</p>
