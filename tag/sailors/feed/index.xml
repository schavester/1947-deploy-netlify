<p>January 15, 1927<br />Los Angeles  </p>
<p>The body of a young man, dressed in sailor&#8217;s togs, was found today by four children playing in an open field near <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=eighteenth+street+and+point+view+avenue,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=50.37814,103.710938&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.045246,-118.372514&#038;spn=0.00649,0.01266&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="Von Bulo's body found">Eighteenth Street and Point View Avenue</a>. The youngsters reported their gruesome discovery to the police, who identified the man as Henry Von Bulo.   </p>
<p>Von Bulo was the third member of a love triangle gone tragically wrong. (Do they ever end happily?) Last month, Curran C. Samuels, age 40, shot his wife, then turned the gun on himself. He died. The missus, though pierced by a bullet that entered her ear and exited her mouth, survived. While in the hospital, Mrs. Samuels told detectives that her husband had probably killed her friend, Henry Von Bulo. She even led them on an unsuccessful search of the vicinity in which his body was eventually found. Mrs. Samuels believes that Von Bulo was killed on December 15, as he did not keep an appointment in Long Beach on that day. Three days later, Mr. Samuels shot his wife near <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=Rossmore+Avenue+and+Wilshire+Boulevard,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=34.045246,-118.372514&#038;sspn=0.00649,0.01266&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.063432,-118.327646&#038;spn=0.006488,0.01266&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="Mrs. Samuels shot near here">Rossmore Avenue and Wilshire Boulevard</a> &quot;where she was engaged as a box-lunch saleswoman.&quot;   </p>
<p>Despite the fact that Von Bulo was dressed in sailor&#8217;s clothing and Mrs. Samuels&#8217;s assertion that he was a member of the merchant marine, Von Bulo&#8217;s stepfather declared that the young man had purchased the uniform and shoes last month in Oakland. He also suggested that his stepson might be the victim of a &quot;bootlegger&#8217;s war,&quot; but declined to further elaborate.  </p>
