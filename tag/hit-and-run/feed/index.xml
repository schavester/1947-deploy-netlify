<p>July 23, 1927 <br />Los Angeles </p>
<p>Detective Lieutenants Kallmeyer, Werne, and Roberts spent all day searching for the three contemptible men who cruelly drove away from a hit-and-run accident which left nineteen year old Aristo Santelanto of <a target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=712+Clara+Street,+Los+Angeles&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=42.445866,74.707031&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.057282,-118.231752&#038;spn=0.01088,0.018239&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=cent&#038;om=1" title="712 Clara Street">712 Clara Street</a>, dead at the scene. </p>
<p>The hardworking Santelanto was with a crew of men repairing railway tracks at <a target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=washington+and+cimarron,+Los++Angeles,+CA&#038;sll=34.09799,-118.331&#038;sspn=0.010874,0.018239&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" title="Washington and Cimarron">Washington Street and Cimarron Avenue</a> when an automobile that was traveling at approximately sixty miles an hour struck him. Without slowing, the death car sped away. </p>
<p>A sharp eyed witness to the crime furnished detectives with numbers from the car&rsquo;s license plate. The investigation was complicated because the crime car had traded hands several times over a period of six months. Undeterred, the cops persisted in their search and as a result, A.T. House, 32, of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Hollywood,_California" title="North Hollywood">Lankershim</a> (now North Hollywood), was handcuffed and taken into custody for suspicion of manslaughter. </p>
<p>House&rsquo;s passengers, Eugene Long, 20, and Paul Post, 32, both of Lankershim, were picked up by police at <a target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=sunset+and+wilcox,+Hollywood,+CA&#038;sll=34.13588,-118.3512&#038;sspn=1.391269,2.334595&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" title="Sunset and Wilcox">Sunset Boulevard and Wilcox Street</a>, where they were employed.&nbsp; The two men were taken to the City Jail and charged with failure to render aid.</div>
