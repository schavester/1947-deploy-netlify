<p>Gentle reader,</p>
<p>Comes the season when the people who put up with you all year begin to make subtle and not so subtle suggestions that they expect to be <em>compensated</em> for this. Are you going to be one of those bad dads or dull honeys whose gifts end up in the hall closet, only to be regifted in some humiliating Secret Santa scenario? Or are you going to listen to your pals from 1947project, and make the holidays a little more <em>interesting?</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does your beloved enjoy tales of historic American misery and death? Why then, they&#8217;ll be wanting the gorgeous new box set compilation <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000ULQV20/ref=nosim/bubblegumbook" target="_blank"><em><span class="sans">People Take Warning! Murder Ballads &amp; Disaster Songs 1913-1938</span></em></a>. It&#8217;s packed with ships a-sinking, trains derailing, prisons a-burning, mines a-blowing, rain not falling, weavils munching, fiends, quakes and nightmares galore.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="240" height="240" border="0" align="left" src="//ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51kpWzDqL9L._AA240_.jpg" />Or do their tastes run more towards Continental miseries? If so, Luc Sante&#8217;s new translation of Felix F&eacute;n&eacute;on&#8217;s  <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&#038;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNovels-Three-Lines-Review-Classics%2Fdp%2F1590172302%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1196704317%26sr%3D8-3&#038;tag=bubblegumbook&#038;linkCode=ur2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=9325">Novels in Three Lines</a></em> will pique their schadenfreude. F&eacute;n&eacute;on was a fascinating Parisian character who, as a sideline to his involvement with bomb-throwing anarchists, editing of Rimbaud and Lautr&eacute;amont and discovery of Georges Seurat, contributed an extraordinary series of brief criminal and oddball news stories to the daily paper <em>Le Matin</em> in 1906. Imagine one of the more complex 1947project tales compressed down to its suggestive essense and you have F&eacute;n&eacute;on&#8217;s evocative and poetic formula. Sante&#8217;s elegant translation captures the poignancy, mystery and eternal grace of the otherwise forgotten traumas of one hundred years ago.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="240" height="240" border="0" align="right" src="//ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZsTF3axcL._AA240_.jpg" />Cuddle up together and cock yer ears to the sounds that made great-grandad guffaw: <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&#038;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FActionable-Offenses-Indecent-Phonograph-Recordings%2Fdp%2FB000QEK41U%2F&#038;tag=bubblegumbook&#038;linkCode=ur2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=9325">Actionable Offenses: Indecent Phonograph Recordings from the 1890s,</a></em>&nbsp; featuring &quot;The Tapeworm Story,&quot; &quot;The Virtues of Raw Oysters&quot; and &quot;Learning a City Gal How to Milk.&quot; Or read aloud from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&#038;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBlack-Lizard-Book-Pulps-Age%2Fdp%2F0307280489%2F&#038;tag=bubblegumbook&#038;linkCode=ur2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=9325"><em>The Black Lizard Big Book of Pulps: The Best Crime Stories from the Pulps During Their Golden Age, The &#8217;20s, &#8217;30s &amp; &#8217;40s</em></a>, which has short stories by recognized masters Chandler, Hammett, Cain, Gardner and Wollrich, and some newly unearthed rarities.</p>

<p>If it&#8217;s images of early Los Angeles that scratch your dear one&#8217;s itch, there are some fine new books to suit, among them Marc Wanamaker and Robert Nudelman&#8217;s Images of America compilation <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&#038;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FEarly-Hollywood-CA-Images-America%2Fdp%2F0738547921%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1196705560%26sr%3D8-1&#038;tag=bubblegumbook&#038;linkCode=ur2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=9325">Early Hollywood</a></em> and Sam Watters&#8217; two-volume <em>Houses of Los Angeles</em>, for which you can pick your period poison: <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&#038;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHouses-Los-Angeles-1885-1919-Watters%2Fdp%2F0926494309%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1196705403%26sr%3D8-2&#038;tag=bubblegumbook&#038;linkCode=ur2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=9325">1885-1919</a></em> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&#038;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHouses-Los-Angeles-1920-1935-Watters%2Fdp%2F0926494317%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1196705403%26sr%3D8-1&#038;tag=bubblegumbook&#038;linkCode=ur2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=9325"><em>1920-1935</em>.</a> (And you already gave &#8217;em a copy of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&#038;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCalifornia-Crazy-Beyond-Vernacular-Architecture%2Fdp%2F0811830187%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1196709773%26sr%3D1-1&#038;tag=bubblegumbook&#038;linkCode=ur2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=9325">California Crazy and Beyond: Roadside Vernacular Architecture</a></em>, right? Of course you did!)&nbsp;</p>

None of whom is the owner of the book&#8217;s most popular object, Christopher Walken&#8217;s bagel.</p>
<p>Or give &#8217;em an Esotouric <a target="_blank" href="http://www.esotouric.com/taxonomy/term/8">gift certificate</a>, one, two, three or four seats aboard the most interesting bus tours in the Southland, and a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.esotouric.com/chandlermap">Raymond Chandler Mystery Map</a> by which to plot noirish adventures of their own. Or engage <a href="http://esotouric.com/crimebo" target="_blank">Crimebo to Clown</a> to come over and put on a &quot;private&quot; show! And if you&#8217;ve ridden the Esotouric bus this year, don&#8217;t forget we&#8217;ve got a 2-for-1 seat offer on the James M. Cain <a target="_blank" href="http://www.esotouric.com/cain-12-15-07">tour</a> on 12/15. </p>
<p>But whatever objects or adventures you exchange this season, it&#8217;s our sincere wish that the year&#8217;s end ushers in a time of peace and contentment for you, yours and all of ours. Thanks for reading, and take good care.</p>
