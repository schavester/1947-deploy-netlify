<p>In an effort to redeem a luscious dairy treatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s good name after being caught in a <a href="/icecream">bootlegging scandal</a> last weekÃ¢â‚¬â€-or perhaps because it was a slow news dayÃ¢â‚¬â€-Dr. Frank McCoy today announced that Ã¢â‚¬Å“ICE CREAM IS A REAL FOOD.Ã¢â‚¬Â </p>
<p>This is the good news weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been waiting for, folks. According to Dr. McCoy (author of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Health and Diet AdviceÃ¢â‚¬Â column), ice cream Ã¢â‚¬Å“should at all times be considered a real food and not a delicacy.Ã¢â‚¬Â Besides being rich in vitamin A and calcium, a half-pint of ice cream has as much lime as a half-pound of butter, four pounds of meat, or three-and-a-half pounds of potatoes. Never heard about the importance of lime in your diet? Me eitherÃ¢â‚¬â€-but if we eat enough ice cream, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll never have to worry about it again. </p>
<p>Dr. McCoy also has a word or two for those who criticize manufacturers for adding gelatin to their ice creams. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ I would suggest that the laws be changed to admit the use of even more gelatin, as this is an excellent food product which makes the ice cream still more palatable and delicious.Ã¢â‚¬Â </p>
<p>Packed with all that lime and gelatin, ice cream is a veritable superfood. Dr. McCoy Ã¢â‚¬Å“suggest[s] that you try some summer lunches with ice cream as the principal part of the meal, using with it any one kind of the acid fruits Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ or Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ cooked and raw nonstarchy vegetables.Ã¢â‚¬Â Ice cream salad, anyone? </p>
<p>Should you find your pants getting a little tight after all that healthfulness, you might want to take a look at Dr. McCoyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book, <i>The Fast Way to Health</i>.
