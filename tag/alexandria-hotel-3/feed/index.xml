<div align="left">Gentle reader,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m writing to pull your sleeve to a wonderful event organized by Nico Bella, co-host of our upcoming Charles Bukowski tour and collaborator on many Esotouric projects. It&#8217;s the Ballroom Blitz, an indie swap meet and art fair in the exquisite Palm Court at the Alexandria Hotel on Sunday, 7/29&#8230; which just happens to be Elizabeth Short&#8217;s birthday. Hard to believe the Black Dahlia would only be 83 had she lived. Anyhoo, Richard and I will have a table of gewgaws, and I&#8217;ll be DJing a set, so let&#8217;s hope that nutty bubblegum music doesn&#8217;t bring the Tiffany ceiling down. It&#8217;s free and promises to be a ball, and we hope to see you there. </p>

<p>Angelenos had a rough time on the road today&mdash;Miss Rachel Miller was struck by Joseph J. Reuter as she crossed the 2600 block of Pico, suffering a fractured skull, concussion of the brain, a broken knee and leg; Henry Van De Kamp was struck by I. Tomioka at East Second and <img loading="lazy" width="125" height="228" border="0" align="left" title="harlanpic" alt="harlanpic" src="//farm1.static.flickr.com/196/466758485_55cabea944_o.gif" />Central, fractured skull, concussion of the brain; J. L. Perrine, who admitted his brakes were &ldquo;not so good,&rdquo; drove into and off of a 400-foot embankment on Effie in the Moreno Highlands, multiple abrasions; four motorists walked away when the front half of their auto was flattened by the Los Angeles Railway car at First and Hill; and one Miss Mollie Reesor miraculously suffered only black eyes and a nasal fracture after being hurled twenty-five feet by a hit-and-run at the corner of Washington Street and Harvard Boulevard.</p>
<p>Most notable, naturally, was the pedestrian-killing of Mrs. Eleanor Bishop, fatally injured when run down by prolific film star <a title="harlan" target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0363218/">Kenneth Harlan</a>, of 810 Camden Drive.&nbsp; Harlan, on his way to a benefit at the Alexandria, stated<img loading="lazy" width="222" height="223" border="0" align="right" title="harlanprevost" alt="harlanprevost" src="//farm1.static.flickr.com/216/466785757_e0726055b6_o.gif" /> that the woman stepped from behind a parked car near Wilshire and Tremaine.&nbsp; After he struck Bishop, he drove her to the office of Dr. James Johnston at Sixth and Western, where she nonetheless expired.&nbsp; Assuming Harlan still had time to make the benefit, his day looked like <a title="harlandrives" target="_blank" href="https://maps.yahoo.com/;_ylc=X3oDMTExNmIycG51BF9TAzI3MTYxNDkEc2VjA2ZwLWJ1dHRvbgRzbGsDbGluaw--#mvt=m&#038;gid4=30109647&#038;q4=201+West+FIfth+Street%2C+Los+Angeles%2C+CA&#038;q3=Sixth+Street+at+Western+Avenue%2C+Los+Angeles%2C+CA&#038;q2=Wilshire+Boulevard+at+Tremaine+Avenue%2C+Los+Angeles%2C+CA&#038;q1=810+N+CAMDEN+DR%2C+Beverly+Hills%2C+CA%2C+90210&#038;trf=0&#038;lon=-118.332195&#038;lat=34.063752&#038;mag=6">this</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Here&#8217;s Harlan putting the lovey dovey on then-wife [and subject of continued tasteless interest] <a title="prevost" target="_blank" href="https://www.francesfarmersrevenge.com/stuff/archive/oldnews/marieprevost.htm">Marie Prevost</a>.&nbsp; They divorced in 1927.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br /> <img loading="lazy" width="157" height="240" border="0" align="left" src="//static.flickr.com/36/112970262_9bd30408e4_m.jpg" />Tongues were wagging on every floor of the <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=W+5th+St+%26+S+Spring+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90013&#038;ll=34.047472,-118.24961&#038;spn=0.030651,0.08008" target="_blank">Alexandria Hotel</a> this morning, following the delicious <em>faux pas</em> of conservative businessman Walter Dinmore, a resident of San Francisco and Los Angeles. Roused by his &quot;Jap&quot; valet to take an important long distance telephone call from Santa Barbara in the lobby, the tousled Dinmore hurried from his room, only to encounter barely supressed merriment at every turn. </p>
<p>First a crew of Catholic girls fresh from their worships chortled, then an elderly lady he waved into the elevator seemed about to perish from the giggles. A bell hop dropped a pitcher of water, so great was his glee upon seeing Mr. Dinmore.</p>
<p>Finally, the gentleman was alone in the telephone booth, where he had a moment to reflect upon the curious afflictions of his fellow guests&#8230; and gaze down his own legs, to see vast billows of pink silk pajama material covering his shoes. Mortified, he dashed for the elevators, but found them engaged. In rising horror, he grabbed a porter and demanded aid. The porter led the humiliated Dinmore into a secret nook below stairs where he could divest himself of his shameful sartorial sin, then slink upward, his errand quite forgotten.</p>
<p><em>Below, a place where pink pajamas are not welcome.</em></p>
