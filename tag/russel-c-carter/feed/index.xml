<div>May 2, 1907<br />
Los Angeles  </p>
<p>Wealthy real estate mogul Russel C. Carter, 939 Denver Avenue, was at 74 in the winter of his years, though comfortably retired.  Despite his vast holdings he brooded over ailments real and imagined and obsessed over the idea he would become helpless, an issue he confided only to his son, Spring Street haberdasher Norman Carter.  </p>
<p>So, when his wife left the house to-day to go about her day&rsquo;s business, R. C. barricaded himself in the barn, secured a rope to both a beam and his neck, and leaped off a stairway.  When Mrs. Carter returned at 6:30, the patriarch nowhere to be found, neighbors were enlisted to break down the barn door, where she found her husband still swinging.  </p>
<p>She was prostrated with grief and is now under the care of physicians at son Norman&rsquo;s home at 3616 Flower Street.  </p>
<p>While there is much to say about the moneyed class and their admirable relationship to self-determination, this writer merely wishes to send his condolences to the family of an Angeleno with vision.</p></div>
