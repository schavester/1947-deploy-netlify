<p>Chemist Fred Paguilnati had been minding his own business in his home at <a title="fredhouse" target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=1528+South+Redondo+Blvd,+Los+Angeles,+Calif.&#038;sll=34.043948,-118.19139&#038;sspn=0.017318,0.029182&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.047059,-118.349962&#038;spn=0.008659,0.014591&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1">1528 Redondo Boulevard</a> when local law enforcement came by for a visit.&nbsp; Which was understandable, since Fred&rsquo;s chemistry business was less about mixing Bromos and more about tending to his 200 <img loading="lazy" width="222" height="215" border="0" align="left" title="fredhouseabove" alt="fredhouseabove" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1176/559528481_b42976ad2d_o.gif" />cases of assorted liquors, at his home bootlegging operation (complete with full bottling plant).&nbsp; Proprietor Fred had driven the coppers away with a gun but they&rsquo;d come back with full force and broken down the door.&nbsp; And so before Municipal Judge Stafford went Fred, where today he was told he could pay $500 ($5,975 USD2005) or take fifty days.&nbsp; He took the fifty days.&nbsp; Ah, this, just a day like any other, here in Volstead-era Los Angeles.</p>
