<p>The Department of Religion at Occidental College is up in arms today, but what could it be about?&nbsp; Gin mills and jake legs?&nbsp; The divorce rate?&nbsp; The suicide rate?&nbsp; The saucily exposed shins of young women?</p>
<p>Naw, it&#8217;s the scientists again.&nbsp; And not just any scientists&#8230; social scientists.<br /><img loading="lazy" width="288" height="229" border="0" align="left" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2273/1907462486_97d4bd9b69_o.jpg" alt="littlealbert" title="littlealbert" /><br />Department head Dr. J. Hudson Ballard condemns behaviorist psychology, saying that it &quot;destroys belief in self, in virtue, in immortality, and in God.&nbsp; It kills the belief in sin, and in the necessity for a Savior, other than as a nerve specialist.&quot;</p>
<p>Then again, those early behaviorists were an ethically suspect bunch.&nbsp; One, John B. Watson, was notorious for his 1920 &quot;Little Albert&quot; experiment, in which an 11-month-old boy was conditioned to experience fear when he was presented with a white rat (previously he&#8217;d gotten along swimmingly with the critters).&nbsp; An unfortunate side effect of the experiment was that little Albert also became distressed when presented with a variety of white, furry things including, but not limited to: a dog, a fur coat, and Watson himself.</p>
<p>Apparently, Watson &quot;meant&quot; to uncondition little Albert, but never got around to it.</p>
<p>So perhaps Dr. Ballard was onto something after all &#8212; but just wait a few years until he gets a load of a fellow named B.F. Skinner.</p></div>
