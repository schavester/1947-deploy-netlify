<div>May 24, 1927<br />Los Angeles</p>
<p><em>Whoo-Whoo!</em> Get outta the road, here comes a cop, or an ambulance. Jeez, usually they drive better than that. This guy doesn&#8217;t give an inch. Muscling his way south through heavy Vermont Avenue traffic after midnight in his Essex, he pushes through the Third, Sixth and Seventh intersections with only some shattered nerves and shouted curses. </p>
<p>By this point he&#8217;s picked up a tail, Detective Lieutenant Vanaken riding with Auto Club man Harry Raymond, who wonder what the deuce this yutz thinks he&#8217;s doing, and if this could be the same siren-happy individual who&#8217;s been reported around town these past three weeks. And then at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=wilshire+and+vermont,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=55.937499,101.425781&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.063326,-118.291533&#038;spn=0.007235,0.012381&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">Wilshire</a>, the inevitable sickening crash of metal on metal, leaving A.J. Hanker and cabbie Oscar Ruiz, thankfully uninjured, sitting in their wrecked cars as Vanaken forces the automotive bully to the curb a block south. </p>
<p>Inside, Dr. R.B. King, 25, X-ray technician out Alhambra way, who denies causing the accident, though he admits he used his siren while not on an official call. Well, since he&#8217;s a doctor, they book King on charges of failing to stop and render aid at an accident scene, and hold him in the City Jail. Meanwhile, we trust, police mechanics are cutting that siren off the Essex, and none to carefully, either.</div>
