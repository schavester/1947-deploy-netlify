Pick yer poison.</p>
<p><strong>About this episode:</strong> This edition of the true crime time travel podcast has a bare bones cast, following Crimebo&#8217;s horrific clown car spill on the 405 and Mary&#8217;s escape to the shore. But Kim, Nathan and Joan are on hand to share several daffy bits of 1927 Southern Californiana, including the tale of a business partnership severed by a hammer, the couple with two legs between &#8217;em caught driving drunk down Riverside way, and a rumination on the timely fad of flagpole sitting. The 1927 and 2007 events calendars are shared and new advertisers come aboard, including the League of Bloated Plutocrats, Masonic Jars and a corrective school for girls whose mothers think they&#8217;re fast. Join us on your<br />computational device! Today!</p>

<div>July 7, 1927<br />Riverside<br /><img loading="lazy" width="449" height="112" border="0" title="oneleg" alt="oneleg" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1231/747852191_ac07a12956_o.gif" /><br />James Clark has but one leg.&nbsp; Fortunately his wife has another.&nbsp; Together, they make one fine two-legged person.&nbsp; Unfortunately, their capacity for imbibery allows for the drunkitude of four persons, their double vision providing the visual acuity of eight. </p>
<p>Seems the Clarks got a few in &lsquo;em and, sans hollow leg and all, the booze went to their collective head, and they thought it a good idea to hop in a flivver and go tearing down <a title="missionblvdriverside" target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=Mission+Boulevard,+Riverside,+Calif&#038;sll=34.032034,-118.469524&#038;sspn=0.015613,0.027809&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.025917,-117.448311&#038;spn=0.124913,0.222473&#038;z=12&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1">Mission Boulevard</a> here in Riverside.&nbsp; Despite the symbiosis that stems from years of wedded camaraderie, his stomping the gas while she pounded brake and clutch didn&rsquo;t work out to their combined advantage&#8230;no, these tourists from the Lone Star state plowed into another vehicle driven by one Fred Stutzman of West Riverside.</p>
<p>Deputy Sheriff Scott hauled the intoxicated unipeds off to the hoosegow, and reported that while both autos were severely damaged, no-one was seriously injured.&nbsp; Scott certainly realized that had someone involved lost a limb, he would have had to fill out the separate irony paperwork, instead of just checking the irony box on his standard report form.</p>
