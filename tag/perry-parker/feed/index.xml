<p>December 20, 1927<br />Los Angeles</p>
<p>As police scour the Bellevue Arms apartment*of &quot;Donald Evans&quot; (an alias for Marion Parker&#8217;s purported slayer Edward Hickman, otherwise known as The Fox), they find portions of a chocolate cake, broken golf clubs, and dirty dishes suggesting a hurried departure. Marion&#8217;s father Perry, upon discovering that the suspect is a former employee at his Seventh and Spring Street bank who he dismissed on fraud charges, says that the voice on the telephone demanding the $1500 ransom was similar to Hickman&#8217;s peculiarly blas&eacute; speech patterns when discussing his offense, but that at no time did he believe the young man meant harm to him or his family. </p>
<p>Little Marion&#8217;s outraged body lies in the morgue, a tiny, heartbreaking bundle with her missing limbs, hollowed core and unseeing eyes sewn open in doll-like pretence of life. In one small mercy, the Parker&#8217;s neighbor is the Autopsy Surgeon, and it&#8217;s this Dr. Wagner who makes the identification and pieces his little friend together from the parts that are brought in, wrapped in newspaper, from where they were scattered in Elysian Park. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The reward for The Fox&#8217; capture has swelled to $62,400, with new pledges from outraged citizens, radio stations and fraternal organizations arriving hourly. Will The Fox be snared, or will he slip away to menace other cities, other daughters? Tune in tomorrow to find out!</p>
<p>*attention, modern readers: the Bellevue Arms is the partly boarded up, expansive brick apartment building flush against the 101 freeway heading north out of downtown. The Fox&#8217; lair was upstairs in the middle rear of the Western, burned-out wing. If you decide to visit, you&#8217;ll come via Sunset Boulevard, and via&#8230; <strong>MARION</strong>.</p>
