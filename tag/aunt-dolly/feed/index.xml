There were also picnics, parades, community service projects, and a near-constant series of elections for the President of the <em>Times</em> Junior Club</p>
<p>Today, Aunt Dolly urged the youngsters to register for the Junior Jubilee, to be held at the Echo Park Recreation Center.  Young readers were tempted with refreshments, a large band, a big show, sports, contests, monkey bars, and a parade.</p>
<p>Boys&#8217; coupons enlisted the tikes in a &quot;best-decorated bike&quot; race and parade, as well as a &quot;Ride-the-Plank&quot; contest, though the wording on girls&#8217; registration forms was equally odd:  &quot;I, (your name here) wish to enter your paper hat contest.  I promise to parade at the Echo Park playground.&quot;</p>
<p>Nothing quite like a forced march in a paper hat to brighten up one&#8217;s Saturday afternoon!
</p>
<p>
The persona of Aunt Dolly was gradually nudged from the Junior Times in the late 1920s, appearing only to write a serial entitled &quot;Snoopy in Do-Do Land.&quot;  The feature abruptly ended in 1931 &#8212; perhaps Aunt Dolly got a buyout?
