<p>January 6, 1927<br />Los Angeles</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="254" height="215" border="0" align="right" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2221/2173157547_c7c33f4460_o.gif" alt="itsaCRAVING" title="itsaCRAVING" />Gladys Nolan, 22, of <a title="Gladys'place" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=5510+lexington+ave,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=32.252269,59.765625&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.092833,-118.30911&#038;spn=0.001028,0.001824&#038;z=19&#038;om=1">5510 Lexington Avenue</a>, had a craving for fine clothes and expensive perfumes.&nbsp; She needed them.&nbsp; Yes, there&rsquo;s a difference between needs and wants.&nbsp; She NEEDED them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Gladys was no klepto.&nbsp; She paid for the items, and not with money from the handbag of some white-glove spinster she&rsquo;d clobbered and left twitching in her death throes down a urine-soaked alley.&nbsp; Gladys paid for these things with all the nicety befitting a girl of refinement, trouble being, she paid for the lovely things with forged checks.</p>
<p>A $200 ($2,206 USD 2007) fur coat and $34 bottle of perfume, she picked up at <a title="6340Hwood" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=6340+Hollywood+Blvd,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90028&#038;sll=34.102566,-118.32799&#038;sspn=0.008226,0.014591&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.102566,-118.32799&#038;spn=0.008226,0.014591&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1">I</a>. <a title="IMagninonHollywood" target="_blank" href="https://jpg2.lapl.org/pics48/00058531.jpg">Magnin&rsquo;s</a>; a check signed in a fictitious name at <a title="MaisonNoir" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=3307+Wilshire+Blvd,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90005&#038;sll=34.062268,-118.294408&#038;sspn=0.004115,0.007296&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.062739,-118.294408&#038;spn=0.00823,0.014591&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1">Maison Blanche</a> allowed her a gown and hat totaling $110.&nbsp; Some killjoy by the name of &ldquo;Deputy District Attoney Frampton&rdquo; got in a twist about this, convincing some other sourpuss called &ldquo;Judge Ambrose&rdquo; to hold her to answer in Superior Court and fix bail at $2000.</p>
<p>Gladys was given probation and told to keep her nose clean.&nbsp; Which she almost did.</p>

<p>Whatever became of Gladys Nolan?&nbsp; A lady whose refinement and obvious taste sadly outdistanced her pocketbook?&nbsp; Guess we&#8217;ll never know.</p>
