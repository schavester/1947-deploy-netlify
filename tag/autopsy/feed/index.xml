<div>Hollywood has been rife with excited talk over the recent death of area man T. C. Hoagland.&nbsp; Hoagland, of Olive Street, raised the interest of locals when his formerly attending physicians, unsure of the cause of this life&rsquo;s cessation, refused to sign a death certificate after Hoagland&rsquo;s demise. Hoagland&rsquo;s cadaver was handed over to a Dr. G. W. Campbell, who therefore performed an autopsy.&nbsp; The rumors afloat among Hoagland&rsquo;s Hollywood neighbors were lessened somewhat when it was revealed that there had been no foul play; rather, Hoagland had simply died of alcoholism.<!-- D(["mb","<span>Ã¯Â¿Â½ </span>This should have come as a surprise to no-one, given HoaglandÃ¯Â¿Â½s reputation for heavy drinking, but the rumors remain unquelled.<span>Ã¯Â¿Â½ </span>An inquest has been ordered and the Coroner shall further investigate HoaglandÃ¯Â¿Â½s death.</div>

<div>Los Angeles</div>



<div>April 30, 1907</div>



<div>Ã¯Â¿Â½</div>



<div>Sixtysomething Edward M. Robbins was a Civil War vet and long-time resident of his little house at 2728 Council Street.<span>Ã¯Â¿Â½ </span>No one ever entered the threshold of his hermit home; he never spoke to his neighbors nor made sign of recognition when he passed them on the street.<span>Ã¯Â¿Â½ </span>He was a quiet and at all times inoffensive man, save for those occasional spells when he would go on a colossal drunk. Then he would be seen through the uncurtained windows strumming an old guitar for a time, until he broke into mad fits of rage, pacing and singing at the top of his voice.</div>



<div>Ã¯Â¿Â½</div>



<div>Given his hermit-like ways, it was no wonder that RobbinsÃ¯Â¿Â½s ten-day disappearance went unnoticed.<span>Ã¯Â¿Â½ </span>But then passersby observed the multitude of flies on the windowsÃ¯Â¿Â½</div>



<div>Ã¯Â¿Â½</div>



<div>Police broke in to find Robbins on a bed heÃ¯Â¿Â½d covered in wrapping paper. Bowie knife, razor and pair of scissors were all nearby, all besmeared with blood, as Robbins had used them all on his wrists and ankles.<span>Ã¯Â¿Â½ </span>But what led to his self-destruction was a Ã¯Â¿Â½queerly fashioned double barreled pistol of ancient makeÃ¯Â¿Â½ that Robbins still gripped tight in his decomposing hand, one barrel having been discharged to form a gaping hole in his neck.</div>



<div>Perhaps Robbins suffered from the mania associated with the<span>Ã¯Â¿Â½ </span>Ã¯Â¿Â½flashing backÃ¯Â¿Â½ of memory common to veterans of the War of Northern Agression.</div>
