<p>Yeah, she threw herself into the part.&nbsp; She could throw a mean left cross too, apparently.&nbsp; In fact she went so nuts she broke several straw hats and mussed up the hair of several spectators and managed to bust the nose, teeth, and blacken the eye of some ponce named Basil Webb.</p>
<p>She is <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0781293/bio" target="_blank" title="eileen">Eileen Sedgwick</a>, and she was portraying an excited Swedish servant girl, cheering the home town team in Metro&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0018413/#comment" target="_blank" title="SKS"><em>Slide, Kelly, Slide</em></a>.&nbsp; And now she stands shoulder to shoulder to shoulder with Metro and the United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company, as Basil bemoans his condition before Referee Crowell of the State Industrial Accident Commission.</p>
<p>We are beguiled by the fetching Ms. Sedgwick!&nbsp; Mr. Webb should consider himself lucky to have be walloped by so charming a creature.</p>
