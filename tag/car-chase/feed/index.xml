										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="body">
<div><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="244" border="0" align="right" src="//static.flickr.com/58/177543542_0023f3f5af_o.gif" alt="1907car" title="1907car" />The other day officers saw a man blazing down Pico in his autoed-mobile and gave chase for two miles.  He was arrested, promised to show for court, and of course did not.  </p>
<p>He had given the name Harry King, but a little sleuthing revealed him to be one H. B. Roy.  Officers were dispatched to Roy&#8217;s home on West Seventh Street.  </p>
<p>Walking down the street, Roy made the cops, ran into a garage, left by the back door, and snuck into his home.  The policemen asked for Roy at the home but was told by a woman he was not in residence.  The cops roughly badged their way in, which forced the woman to call out reinforcements&mdash;two snarling, snapping bulldogs.  The officers drew their revolvers and advanced on the dogs, loudly proclaiming their intent to shoot them.  This got Roy&rsquo;s attention, and he emerged from the back of the house, to wind up in the paddy wagon.  </p>
<p>(While the arrest of J. S. Cravens for a similar high-speed driving offence, posted here June 22, did not mention the speed attained in his chase, in this case Roy&rsquo;s pursuit was clocked at forty-five miles per hour.) </p></div>
