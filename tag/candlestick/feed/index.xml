<p>May 15, 1927<br />Los Angeles  </p>
<p>Nobody ever said making a living in the arts was easy, but G. Leavitt Browne got more than he bargained for shortly after noon today when two young men showed up at his vocal studio located on the sixth floor of the <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=845+s.+broadway,+los+angeles,+CA&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=62.443704,106.171875&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.044161,-118.255355&#038;spn=0.008125,0.01296&#038;z=16&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="Location of the former Majestic Theater Building">Majestic Theater Building, 845 S. Broadway</a>.   </p>
<p>Browne told police the youths had come in response to his newspaper advertisement. Indeed, the three discussed the possibility of taking vocal lessons with Browne. But when the voice teacher turned away for a moment, his would-be students revealed their true natures: one grabbed him by the arm and the other threatened to strike the flustered music man with a heavy candlestick if he offered any resistance.   </p>
<p>The young Philistines made off with $2.00 in cash and a wristwatch worth $20.00. No word on whether Browne cancelled his newspaper ad.  </p>
