<p>November 5, 1907<img loading="lazy" width="300" height="311" border="0" align="right" src="//static.flickr.com/110/290191355_8a62baf5d1_o.gif" alt="boozesign" title="boozesign" /><br />Los Angeles </p>
<p>Just as an innocent toke of reefer leads to a lifetime of laudanum addiction, everybody knows that electric signs lead to&hellip;neon!</p>
<p>Neon wouldn&rsquo;t be introduced to the United States until 1923 (specifically, at the Earl C. Anthony Packard dealership, 10th &amp; Hope Street).&nbsp; That first reefer toke, though&hellip;that was the electric sign&hellip;</p>
<p>Property owners of 1907 argue that electric signs, particularly those of the swinging variety which jut from the fa&ccedil;ades of buildings, make the streets look tawdry.&nbsp; Moreover, they nullify the illumination systems on principal business streets, and will become eyesores and nuisances.</p>
<p>The Mayor, however, is outspoken in favor of electric signs.&nbsp; They illuminate business thoroughfares, and are an ornament to the city.&nbsp; A man of vision, our Mayor Harper.</p>
<p>But what to do, then, with the Jim &ldquo;de champ&rdquo; Jeffries&rsquo; new saloon sign on South Spring?&nbsp; He has had one built and installed, swung over the sidewalk, &ldquo;bearing in letters as big as one of his mitts the magic pugilistic name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While this type of signage violates numerous and sundry City ordinances, the Board of Public Works has ignored similar signs in the downtown area that advertise caf&eacute;s and theaters, who are crying foul in that municipal authorities have allowed such signs to hang for the last year.&nbsp; Because of Jeffries&rsquo; transgression, he and all other sign owners received letters from the City Attorney demanding the removal of any and all projecting signage, the worry being that should these signs become commonplace, &ldquo;the sidewalks would be converted into tunnels darkened and obstructed by a covering of advertising signs.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Moreover, a proposed ordinance shall prohibit signage advertising liquor.&nbsp; Can this be?</p>
<p>Mayor Harper stands firm.&nbsp; What will become of our city?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="256" height="405" border="0" align="bottom" src="//static.flickr.com/122/290179644_6b47e5b767_o.jpg" alt="electricyouth" title="electricyouth" />Here&rsquo;s a vision of the future:&nbsp; electric signage along Broadway, ca. 1920, as pictured in, uh, <a href="https://losangelesneonbook.com/" target="_blank">this book</a>.</p>
