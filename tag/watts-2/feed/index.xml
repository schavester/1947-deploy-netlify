<div>At a poolroom in Watts (where, it is said, liquor is sold without a license), Mr. H. E. Welch became involved in a domestic disagreement with his wife Myrtle.Â  Accordingly, she beat him with a pool cue and then shot him twice in the head. â€œIâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />m used to being shot at,â€ said Mr. Welch later this evening while being attended to at Receiving Hospital.Â  â€œMy wife has a lot of disorderly friends and the poolroom is full of these nowadays.Â  The gun with which she shot me was in my pocket and she took it from me.â€</div>
