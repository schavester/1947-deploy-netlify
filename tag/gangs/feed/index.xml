<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="288" height="223" border="0" align="left" title="pulvaheadline" alt="pulvaheadline" src="//static.flickr.com/52/173311519_5c5a0fbd1b_o.jpg" />What can one say about pretty young Eva Pulva?&nbsp; She lived in a lonely cottage on West Fifty-Fourth, and though her mother and sister lived on East Fifty-Seventh, she told people she had no kin.&nbsp; Her gentleman friends knew little of her.&nbsp; The police knew her best of all&mdash;watching as she, a ward of the probation department, came to the verge of trouble via men of low character.&nbsp; But she&rsquo;d secured her nice little cottage, and things seemed to be going well&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;until she shaved her head and disappeared.&nbsp; The cops looked for her to offer her protection from whatever trouble she was in, but didn&rsquo;t find her until she had a self-inflicted bullet in her chest.</p>
<p>Her note read &ldquo;Dearest Sister:&nbsp; You will find my trunk at 2739 Budlong avenue.&nbsp; Please don&rsquo;t tell the lady you are a relative of mine.&nbsp; I told her I had no relation.&nbsp; So let me go knowing that one person on your Sunny Earth don&rsquo;t think me a liar.&nbsp; I am sorry I don&rsquo;t leave espense money but (I belong to a gang that have my money) and when they hear I am goine most likely you will get it.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t tell mother.&nbsp; I wrote anything.&nbsp; Put me anywhere sister.&nbsp; I do don&rsquo;t care where.&nbsp; I know you understand and my dear I am no good here&hellip;I am a coward to live but not a coward to die.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;</p>
