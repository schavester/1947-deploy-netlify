<p>October 6, 1927<br />Fullerton</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only because of a kind fate which guards the lives of children at play was Virginia Mae Pike, two and one-half years of age, alive today&hellip;&rdquo; &hellip;or so reads the lead from this story.&nbsp; Oh sure, that&rsquo;s <em>got</em> to be it, it&rsquo;s all thanks to some rather specialized application of Fortuna Primegenia. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Seems Mr. and Mrs. George Pike tented their home at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=365+W+Truslow+Ave,+Fullerton,+CA+92832&#038;sll=33.868064,-117.931516&#038;sspn=0.008018,0.014591&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=33.868064,-117.931516&#038;spn=0.008018,0.014591&#038;t=k&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="thehomeonTruslow">365 West Truslow Avenue</a>, into which fumigators pumped pure cyanide gas.&nbsp; According to the medical experts, two breaths of the lethal fumes would kill a grown man, and here Virginia Mae stood erect in the stuff for <em>two minutes</em>.&nbsp; There she was, inside the tent, still upright but unconscious, when they pulled her out, gave her some mouth to mouth, and off she went.</p>
<p>There are only four possible explanations:</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;you cannot kill what is already dead; therefore, she is a zombie.&nbsp; She will eventually chomp on her parents, who will in turn infect others&mdash;this should probably be dealt with.&nbsp; Unfortunately for the Pikes, decapitation remains the best proven method for dealing with a zombie.</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;she is wampyear.&nbsp; Or vompyure.&nbsp; Or however one spells &ldquo;vampire&rdquo; to make it phonetically accurate.&nbsp; This should also be dealt with.&nbsp; Again, traditional methods apply.</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she is a suprahuman.&nbsp; Virginia Mae should be spirited away to a secret military base to breed an army of bioresistant super-soldiers, of course.</p>
<p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Pikes hired crummy fumigators. &nbsp;</p>
<p>At least these are more probable explanations than the kindly consort of some damn Moiraes, #4 certainly so should you shave down the argument with Occam&rsquo;s razor.</p>

<p>But don&#8217;t say we didn&#8217;t warn you.&nbsp;</p>
