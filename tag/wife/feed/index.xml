<p>March 30, 1907<br /> Los Angeles&nbsp;</p>
<p>Newlyweds Mr. and Mrs. Paul Solf, a couple from Denver who have been honeymooning at the Estelle at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=312+W+1st+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90012&#038;ll=34.055255,-118.245807&#038;spn=0.013618,0.037122" target="_blank">312 1/2 West First Street</a>, paid a visit to the police this evening at the insistence of the lady.  </p>
<p>Paul Solf told the desk sergeant that he had returned to their room earlier, to find his wife reading a letter from a former admirer. As he snatched it away, a photograph fell out, and the pair commenced to arguing. After a time, Mrs. Solf said that if he did not accompany her to the police station, she would call for them herself. Thinking she was bluffing, he joined her in a perambulation towards Central Station.</p>
<p> Upon entering, Mrs. Solf declared that Paul Solf had threatened her with a revolver. He denied this, but a quick search revealed a heavy revolver on his person. Solf was locked up, while officers determined that he had a letter for $5000 credit from a Denver bank, and nearly as much in cash. On reflection, Mrs. Solf decided she didn&#8217;t wish to prosecute, but officers still plan to charge him for carrying a concealed weapon.</p>
<p>Solf is a race horse man, and his bride a bit of a gambler.&nbsp;</p>
