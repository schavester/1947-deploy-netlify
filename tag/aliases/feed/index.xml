<p>O! What a tangled web some weave when first they practice to deceive their spouses. A few days ago, Theodore A. Kocotis returned home to an empty house&mdash;his wife, Carrie, was missing. Five long days later, there came a telephone call:&nbsp; Carrie Kocotis was desperately ill in a Santa Monica sanatorium, the result of a &ldquo;face-lifting&rdquo; operation. Kocotis made haste, but his wife died before he arrived. </p>
<p>The grieving widower hired Attorney Earl S. Wakeman to start probate proceedings. But instead of a few pennies&rsquo; worth of pin money squirreled away here and there, Wakeman discovered $10,000 in chattel (almost $120,000 in 2007 dollars). And then there were the aliases. As Carrie L. Brody, Mrs. Kocotis acted as a housemother in a sorority; she conducted other business under the names of Carrie Sullivan and Carrie L. Williams. Her safety deposit box was rented in the name of Carrie Wright, and it was there she stored her jewels and securities.</p>
<p>Wakeman announced today that he intends to see that the events surrounding Mrs. Kocotis&rsquo;s untimely demise are fully investigated by the District Attorney. </div>
