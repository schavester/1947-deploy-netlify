<p>August 12, 1927<br />Los Angeles</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="243" height="287" border="0" align="left" title="leap" alt="leap" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1292/1078635857_379109a075_o.gif" />Alice Miller, 24, was hanging out with her buddies Helen Myers, Norman Myers and Robert Wilkenson&mdash;the four of them all out on bail on various charges of grand larceny, pickpocketing, and vagrancy&mdash;in her little room at the Hillman Apartments, <a title="hillmanapts" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=1010+Ingraham+Street,+Los+Angeles,+Calif&#038;sll=34.084512,-118.184609&#038;sspn=0.008548,0.014312&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.051699,-118.262265&#038;spn=0.008551,0.014312&#038;t=h&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1">1010 Ingraham Street</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a knock on the door.&nbsp; Seems that Robert Seaner, the bondsman who&rsquo;d bailed Alice out when she got pinched for pickpocketing in downtown department stores, has just received some disturbing news from Chief of Police Laubenhemer out in Milwaukee.&nbsp; Was it true, Alice, that back in Milwaukee, where you were known as Mrs. Mary Becker, you escaped from the Industrial Home for Women at <a href="https://www.wi-doc.com/taycheed.htm" target="_blank" title="taycheedah">Taycheedah</a>?&nbsp; Would you be so kind as to come with me down to the station so we can sort this thing out?&nbsp; Sure thing, says Alice, let me go in the other room for a moment and change into my street clothes.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="126" height="221" border="0" align="right" title="alice" alt="alice" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1233/1078635841_aeaa75f201_o.gif" />But the moments come and go and the collected find the room empty.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s chosen death over jail:&nbsp; through the open window, they see her broken body lying four stories below.</p>
<p>Despite the basal skull fracture, broken nose and arm, and assorted internal injuries, Alice survives to stand trial.&nbsp; On November 26, Alice is freed on the charge of shoplifting, due to insufficient evidence; she is promptly rearrested by Milwaukee officers, who set off with their <a href="https://www.aclu.org/prison/women/25405prs20060502.html" target="_blank" title="backtohell">prisoner</a>.<br />&nbsp;<img loading="lazy" width="300" height="216" border="0" align="left" title="taycheedah" alt="taycheedah" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1311/1078635867_5fcf855b7b_o.gif" /></p>
