Thompson faced much stiffer penalties.</p>
<p>A librarian at LAPL noticed that the copy of Eugene O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s controversial play <em>All God&#8217;s Chillun Got Wings</em> was at large, and traced the missing copy to Thompson.&nbsp; About 30 library books were found in Thompson&#8217;s home at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=1406+e.+110th+st.,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=27.643082,59.765625&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=33.937147,-118.249969&#038;spn=0.00705,0.014591&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="clydethompson">1406 E. 110th St.</a>, and he was sentenced to 60 days in jail, 2 days for each stolen book.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="124" height="240" border="0" align="right" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1331/1477446423_32a84bcfbe_m.jpg" alt="samuelwardlaw" title="samuelwardlaw" />During the 1920s, the Los Angeles Public Library employed detectives to investigate thefts and mutilation of library material.&nbsp; A 1929 <em>Times</em> article featured the efforts of Special Investigator Samuel Wardlaw, a man as hardcore as he was humorless.</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">He interrogated patrons in the stacks when he observed them hiding books, and once used a sorority pin to track down a young woman who tried to sneak a rare volume of Chaucer out under her coat.&nbsp; While he seemed to have a soft spot in his heart for the children he captured, Wardlaw regarded most library patrons with a certain degree of contempt.&nbsp; He said, &quot;Sometimes I think the Los Angeles Public Library must be on the mailing or calling list of every crank and eccentric in the West.&quot;</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">While the library detectives frequently visited people at home to reclaim stolen books, it was rare that criminal charges were pursued.&nbsp; No particular reason was given for poor Clyde Thompson&#8217;s exceptionally harsh sentence.</div>
