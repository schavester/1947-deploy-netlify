<p>July 6, 1907<br /> Los Angeles&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hot! damn but it&#8217;s been hot and humid, too, the steamiest early July since records have been kept. Sure there were hotter single days&#8211;like July 25, 1891 when the mercury topped 109&#8211;but no one can recall a week when the very dawn temperature broke 80 degrees, with no relief offered by the night.</p>
<p>Mrs. Carrie Gilbert&#8217;s solution to the grisly weather was to get drunk and sleep out-of-doors, not in a cosy sleepying porch at home at 617 1/2 East Sixth Street, but alongside the railway behind the commission house at First and Central Streets. Deep in the darkness her horrible screams were heard; a passing train had severed her left foot. Taken to Receiving Hospital, the lady slipped into a merciful stupor. Clever, clever dipsomaniac. Shock, they say, leaves one feeling <em>icy cold</em>&#8230; </p>
