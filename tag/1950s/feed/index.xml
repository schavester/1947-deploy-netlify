<p>UPDATE: 12/22 has sold out, 12/29 tour was added and sold out within a day&#8230; but you can still get on the waiting lists!</p>
<p>Gentle reader,</p>
<p>We are giddy to announce that our Christmas week tour will be a very special event: &quot;James Ellroy Digs L.A.&quot;</p>
<p>Our host on the tour will be the acclaimed crime novelist and memoirist whose highly personal take on L.A.&#8217;s underworld from the 1940s through the 1960s is as captivating as it&#8217;s horrifying.</p>
<p>Passengers will gather on Saturday 12/22 at Arnie Morton&#8217;s downtown (which is opening specially for our group at noon, with a limited snack and bar menu), then get on the bus at 1pm sharp for James Ellroy&#8217;s personal guided tour through the city that haunts his dreams and inspires his art. <br />&nbsp;<br />We&#8217;ll accompany the author on an uncensored time travel journey to tony Hancock Park, where he stalked his teenage classmates and later broke into houses. . . to the Hollywood flats to explore some of the heinous 1950s murder cases that fascinated him as a youth and continue to feed his obsessions. . . and out to El Monte, where his mother Geneva was murdered, the unsolved crime that runs through all his work, from &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot; to &quot;My Dark Places.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />When asked what passengers could expect on this tour, James Ellroy said, &quot;I dig L.A. because I&#8217;m from here. My parents hatched me in a cool locale. I&#8217;m desperate to impress people, I&#8217;m a good talker, I know a shitload about L.A. and I want to share it. On this tour, you&#8217;ll get L.A. crime and social history on an unparalleled AND intimate scale.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />So get on the bus at Arnie Morton&#8217;s in downtown LA on December 22 and spend your holidays with the demon dog of American literature, on what&#8217;s sure to be the coolest ticket in town. </p>
<p>Tickets are $60/person, available from <a href="https://www.esotouric.com/ellroy" target="_blank">https://www.esotouric.com/ellroy</a> or by <a href="https://www.47upgradepath7.richardschave.com//feedback" target="_self">emailing</a> to reserve and then sending a check. Seats are extremely limited on this special event tour; and sorry, no discounts or Esotouric season pass tickets will be honored.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Upcoming Esotouric bus tour schedule:<br /></strong>Sat Nov 17&nbsp; &ndash; Pasadena Confidential tour<br />Sat Dec 8 &#8211; Raymond Chandler&#8217;s LA<br />Sat Dec 15 &#8211; James M. Cain&#8217;s So California Nightmare<br />Sat Dec 22 &ndash; James Ellroy Digs L.A. <br />Sun Jan 15 &#8211; Vroman&#8217;s edition, The Real Black Dahlia<br />&nbsp;</p>
