<p>In fairness, Mabel did, on the sidewalk in front of Helen Salyer&rsquo;s house, give George one last chance, asking him to come back to her.&nbsp; George approached and said, firmly, no.&nbsp; With that, Mabel shot him in the stomach; the force of the blast turned him around and Mabel shot him again in the back.&nbsp; Mabel walked back to her car, got in, and sat calmly there until authorities arrived. &nbsp;</p>

<p>(With no defense offered other than the &ldquo;unwritten law,&rdquo; on May 19 she was ordered held to Superior Court for trial by Municipal Judge Rosencranz on charges of assault with intent to commit murder.&nbsp; She told the court &ldquo;I shot him because I loved him&rdquo; and reiterated &ldquo;sure I shot him&mdash;if I couldn&rsquo;t live with him I wasn&rsquo;t going let anyone else live with him.&rdquo;&nbsp; The jury, out an hour, gave her a full acquittal on May 24.)</p>

<p>December 11, 1927<br />
Hollywood</p>
<p>The death of motion-picture actor George Donald Bailey was announced this morning. The 63-year-old thespian complained of feeling ill yesterday. A doctor was summoned, but Bailey died within a few hours. The death certificate, signed by Dr. C.D. Baker (a friend of the deceased), stated the cause as heart disease. </p>
<p>The matter would seem to rest there, but this afternoon Bailey&#8217;s widow was visited by her daughter, Blanche Olivarias, and Blanche&#8217;s sister-in-law, Miss Tommy Olivarias. The women brewed a soothing pot of coffee, sipped from their cups, and immediately were gripped by nausea. Tommy, in particular, became violently sick and felt a choking sensation in her throat. </p>
<p>Unusual, you think, but this is where the plot thickens:  &#8220;&#8216;My husband clutched at his throat just prior to his death,&#8217; Mrs. Bailey said. &#8216;He kept mumbling he was being choked to death'&#8221;Ã¢â‚¬â€just after having a cup of coffee from the same fatal pot. Indeed, doctors say the only reason Tommy recovered was emergency treatment. </p>
<p>The county coroner requested a chemical analysis of Bailey&#8217;s organs. The coffee pot and whatever liquid remained in it were turned over to the county chemist. Results were expected sometime the following week. </p>
<p>Did heart disease kill George D. BaileyÃ¢â‚¬â€or was it poison? Were his widow, daughter, and her sister-in-law victims of the same toxin? Alas, the <i>Times</i> never reported on the outcome of the autopsy or tests on the coffee pot.
