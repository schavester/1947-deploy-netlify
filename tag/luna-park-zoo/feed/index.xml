<div align="left">In this, our nation&#8217;s 152nd year of independence, residents of Los Angeles found time for picnics, sun-bathing, fireworks, and even a little rioting.</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">Over a ton of barbecued beef was served in Echo Park at the National Association of Letter Carriers 4th of July picnic, where about 5000 federal employees and their families gathered to feast, dance to music by the Letter Carriers&#8217; Band, play baseball, and of course, listen to a rousing speech by Postmaster O&#8217;Brien himself.&nbsp; The Knights of Columbus went to <a title="lunapark" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=3800+mission+rd.,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=34.031287,-118.264539&#038;sspn=0.008536,0.020084&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.069938,-118.199608&#038;spn=0.008532,0.020084&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1">Luna Park</a>, while the Irish partied at <a title="rosehill" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=4520+mercury+rd,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=34.069938,-118.199608&#038;sspn=0.008532,0.020084&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.086094,-118.190145&#038;spn=0.068241,0.160675&#038;z=13&#038;om=1">Rose Hill Park</a>.&nbsp; It is estimated that about 500,000 Angelenos took in one of the many oceanside fireworks extravaganzas up and down the beach.&nbsp; Passenger records between Los Angeles and the Catalina Islands were shattered also shattered this weekend.</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">In Chinatown, however, the mood was less festive.&nbsp; Tired of being arrested for violating the City&#8217;s fireworks ordinances, a mob of about 100 Chinatown residents surrounded a police officer and firefighter, and threatened them with violence.&nbsp; Their &quot;skyrocketing oriental tempers&quot; were quelled when a police riot squad showed up and arrested the mob&#8217;s two ringleaders.&nbsp; Patrolman Fogarty and Fireman Hoag were found holding the mob at bay from a corner on <a title="losangelesstreet" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=n.+los+angeles+st.,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=34.05332,-118.24498&#038;sspn=0.136535,0.32135&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.054775,-118.239799&#038;spn=0.008533,0.020084&#038;z=16&#038;om=1">North Los Angeles St.</a>, near Ferguson Alley when help arrived; however, neither man was harmed.</p>
</div>
<div align="left">And sadly, the 4th of July holiday was darkened by the children who fell victim to prematurely exploding fireworks.&nbsp; While most injuries were not severe, 6-year-old Mary Hackwell of <a title="maryhackwell" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=1047+w.+88th+st.,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=34.054775,-118.239799&#038;sspn=0.008533,0.020084&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=33.958116,-118.292842&#038;spn=0.008543,0.020084&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1">1047 1/2 W. 88th St.</a> hovered near death at General Hospital after a sparkler ignited her clothes.&nbsp; Her father also sustained serious burns while putting out the flames.&nbsp; Little Mary died on July 8, 1927.</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">On a lighter note, check some zany goings-on at the old Luna Park Zoo <a href="https://jpg2.lapl.org/pics20/00019654.jpg" target="_blank" title="lunaparklion">here</a> and <a href="https://jpg2.lapl.org/pics20/00019636.jpg" target="_blank" title="manhugsbear">here</a>.&nbsp; If you got a notion to hug a bear, have your car washed by an orangutan, or feed your baby to a lion, this was apparently the place to do it.&nbsp;</div>
