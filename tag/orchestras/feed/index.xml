Jan. 19, 1907<br />
<!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->Los Angeles <!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p>  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Despite his ill health, Harley Hamilton drove himself to conduct a concert by the Los Angeles Symphony because he believed so much in bringing the music of Tchaikovsky (or in those days, Tschaikowsky) to the public.<span style="">  </span>The concert at hand is the West Coast premiere of TchaikovskyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Symphony No. 4.</p>
<p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://www.lmharnisch.com/images/1907_0119B.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 215px; height: 463px;" src="//www.lmharnisch.com/images/1907_0119B.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ã¢â‚¬Å“Harley Hamilton, too ill to leave his house, is just finishing his arrangements for the work of the symphony orchestra,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times says of his labors on the concert series. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ã¢â‚¬Å“During the entire past month the director has devoted the major part of every day, propped up with pillows on his couch, to the preparation of the splendid symphony programmes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ã¢â‚¬Å“The symphony orchestra is the darling of his heartÃ¢â‚¬â€and in several instances it has come near costing him his life. Mr. Hamilton puts more money into the symphony work than he ever receives from it. He has carried the orchestra over the years of comparative failure, supported its burdens almost alone in time of public adversity and devoted his only hours of rest or recreation to a constant effort to better its personnel and its music.Ã¢â‚¬Â</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To make ends meet, Hamilton teaches music students, conducts a theater orchestra and even performs in pit orchestras, coming to the rescue when many players were banned from a performance of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mignon.Ã¢â‚¬Â (See Ã¢â‚¬Å“<a href="https://1947project.com/oh-god-the-bassoon">Oh, God, the Bassoon!</a>Ã¢â‚¬Â)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Of TchaikovskyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Symphony No. 4, Hamilton said: Ã¢â‚¬Å“I am quite a Russian in my tastes. TschaikowskyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s art is a fundamental bulwark upon which the splendid individual music of modern Russia stands. There is an Oriental richness about his writingsÃ¢â‚¬â€spiced fragrance in every phraseÃ¢â‚¬â€violet skies, hot suns, tropic exuberanceÃ¢â‚¬â€qualities that are no more inherent to the bleak steppes than the thrilling tenderness of Italian melodies. These evidence the Asiatic strain that purples the lighter Russian bloodÃ¢â‚¬â€the dominating, compelling force of the ancient Tartars.Ã¢â‚¬Â </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Hamilton conducted the concert (which also included GoldmarkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“SakuntalaÃ¢â‚¬Â or Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rustic WeddingÃ¢â‚¬Â and Arthur FooteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Serenade in E Major) at the <a href="https://1947project.com/mason-opera-house">Mason Opera House</a>.<span style="">  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Because of a relapse of Ã¢â‚¬Å“nervous rheumatism,Ã¢â‚¬Â he Ã¢â‚¬Å“was ordered to the strictest confinement by his physician. Throwing caution to the winds, however, he worked through a long rehearsal yesterday morning and yesterday afternoon, partly standing, partly sitting in his chair, directed the lengthy concert after which he returned home physically exhausted but [illegible] triumphant,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times says.<span style="">  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For a short time, the Los Angeles Symphony was in competition with the more recent Los Angeles Philharmonic, but it eventually disbanded.<span style="">  </span>Hamilton died at his home, 1120 Arapahoe, in 1933 at the age of 72, having given birth to the Los Angeles Symphony and the Los Angeles WomenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Orchestra (later the California WomenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Symphony Orchestra). </p>
