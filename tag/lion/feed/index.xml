<p>Cinema actor <a title="gordonstanding" target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0822057/">Gordon Standing</a>, of noble acting stock, had played Horatio in the &ldquo;Modern Hamlet&rdquo; on the East Coast stage.&nbsp; Back East he&rsquo;d starred in Lasky, Vitagraph, Inspiration and D.W. Griffith film productions.&nbsp;&nbsp; But then he got it into his head to come Out West.&nbsp; Though he&rsquo;d been wounded several times in the Marine Corps during the Big Scrap, nothing could have prepared him for the horrors of Hollywood.</p>
<p>At first, all was well at <a title="seligzoo" target="_blank" href="https://www.lincolnheightsla.com/selig/">Selig</a> <a title="seligII" target="_blank" href="https://employees.oxy.edu/jerry/seligzoo.htm">Zoo</a> <a title="seligstudiowiki" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selig_Polyscope_Company">Studio</a>.&nbsp; Standing&rsquo;d been working alongside his old buddy Elmo &ldquo;<a title="elmolincoln" target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0511104/">First Tarzan</a>&rdquo; Lincoln and a new buddy, one giant lion, in the cheapie serial &ldquo;<a title="KOTJ" target="_blank" href="https://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/K/KingoftheJungle1927.html">King of the Jungle</a>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Apparently Standing had been getting along peachy-like with his new feline friend, until Standing changed his make-up, putting on a beard, and old Leo didn&rsquo;t recognize him.&nbsp; The maned one attacked!&nbsp; It took fifteen men to pull the animal off Standing, who was rushed to Roosevelt Hospital with severe bites and slashes about the neck and shoulders.&nbsp; King of the Jungle was no match for King of the Beasts.&nbsp; (Interestingly, <a title="allmovie" target="_blank" href="https://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&#038;sql=2:67553">allmovie.com</a> would have us believe Standing was trampled by a &quot;rampaging elephant;&quot; perhaps they were thinking of the elephants that graced the entrance to the zoo.)</p>

<p>The Selig Studio had a &quot;jungle area&quot; in which to film, but their lions weren&#8217;t of the perfoming type; the question stands, then, was the rent-a-lion that killed Standing none other than famous snarling L. B. Mayer sidekick Slats, denizen of <a title="gayslionfarm" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay's_Lion_Farm">Gay&rsquo;s Lion Farm</a> (where lions would run amok a mere sixteen months later)?</p>
