<p>May 1, 1927<br />Los Angeles&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the <em>Times</em> today, a round-up of street crime incidents calculated to terrorize city residents, or at least discourage freelance musicians, good Samaritans and lingering outside a lady&#8217;s home in an open car&#8211;sheesh, buddy, get a room. </p>
<p>Clarinetist Antonio Cili thought he was being hired to play a gig when three gentlemen picked him up at Sixth and Broadway, <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&#038;hl=en&#038;saddr=S+Broadway+%26+W+6th+St,+Los+Angeles,+Los+Angeles,+California,+United+States&#038;daddr=Pecan+%26+W+4th+St,+Los+Angeles,+Los+Angeles,+California,+United+States&#038;sll=34.048073,-118.252029&#038;sspn=0.007378,0.013325&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=14&#038;om=1" target="_blank">drove</a> to Fourth and Pecan, tossed him from the car, beat him silly and stole his instrument and $20.</p>
<p>Jennie Emerson of 2611 Vallejo Street was nearly run down in the street while crossing at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=Daly+and+Manitou,+Los+Angeles,+90031&#038;sll=34.04551,-118.236885&#038;sspn=0.029514,0.053301&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.073315,-118.215594&#038;spn=0.007376,0.013325&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">Daly and Manitou</a> in Lincoln Heights, and while recovering her wits confronted by the armed driver and his pal, who threatened to kill her before stealing her purse.</p>
<p>A bandit robbed J. Maganuma of $40 cash and a serving of chop suey at his restaurant at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=4911+South+Broadway&#038;sll=34.092224,-118.311167&#038;sspn=0.007374,0.013325&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=33.999664,-118.278358&#038;spn=0.007383,0.013325&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">4911 South Broadway</a>. It was not reported if Mr. Maganuma spat in the food, but we certainly hope so.</p>
<p>A. Eisner was carjacked at First and New Hampshire, forced to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&#038;hl=en&#038;saddr=First+and+New+Hampshire,+Los+Angeles,+CA&#038;daddr=6th+and+Lucas,+Los+Angeles,+CA&#038;sll=34.073315,-118.215594&#038;sspn=0.007376,0.013325&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=14&#038;om=1" target="_blank">drive</a> to Sixth and Lucas and relieved of his $100 stick pin, $40 watch and $8 cash. Maybe it&#8217;s Eisner&#8217;s home address of <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=5579+Santa+Monica+Boulevard&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=56.987104,109.160156&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.092224,-118.311167&#038;spn=0.007374,0.013325&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">5579 Santa Monica Boulevard</a> or the fancy stick pin that gives this brief tale the whiff of rough trade, or possibly we just have dirty minds.</p>
<p>Joseph Michael, while strolling by a doorway near <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=N+Main+St+%26+E+1st+St,+Los+Angeles,+Los+Angeles,+California+90012,+United+States&#038;sll=34.05332,-118.24498&#038;sspn=0.236092,0.426407&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;cd=2&#038;ll=34.053691,-118.243403&#038;spn=0.007378,0.013325&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">First and Main </a>was lassoed by a couple of rope-wielding miscreants who strangled Michael into unconsciousness and stole $35, this just two blocks from Central Police HQ.  </p>
<p>Kindly Arthur Roper was driving along (now defunct) California Street near Figueroa when he spied a fashionably garbed young lady in apparent distress in the middle of the road. He stopped to lend aid and her friend hopped onto Roper&#8217;s running board with a revolver, which was clapped to Roper&#8217;s chest while the gal riffled his pockets of $53 cash.  </p>
<p>And then there was Jacob L. Johannes of 228 South Rodeo Drive, who was sitting in a car with Miss Marie Boucher outside her home at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=5806+Carlton+Way,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=34.063745,-118.277275&#038;sspn=0.029508,0.053301&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.101837,-118.316596&#038;spn=0.007374,0.013325&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">5806 Carlton Way</a> when a fiend with a revolver relieved the lady of a $1000 fur coat, $75 watch and $50 bar pin. Johannes lost $6 cash. Buddy, you can&#8217;t <em>afford</em> a room&#8230; or Miss Boucher. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now be careful out there!&nbsp;</p>
