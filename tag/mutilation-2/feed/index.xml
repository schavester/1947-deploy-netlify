Vernon Junior High, saying, &quot;I spoke with Mrs Holt, and am satisfied that I would have acted as she did if I were confronted with the same circumstances.&quot;</p>
<p>Holt excused Marion Parker from school on Thursday, December 15 when a slender man came to the desk and asked for &quot;P.M. Parker&#8217;s youngest daughter,&quot; saying that her father had been in an automobile accident.&nbsp; Holt hesitated, knowing that Marion was a twin.&nbsp; However, the man persisted, saying, &quot;I am an employee at the bank where Mr. Parker is chief clerk, and if there is any doubt in your mind, here is the bank&#8217;s telephone number.&nbsp; You may call there.&quot;</p>
<p>Convinced, Holt sent an office assistant to get Marian from class.&nbsp; &quot;Marion was nervous and excited when I told her that her father had been injured.&nbsp; The news completely broke up a little Christmas party the children were having in their room, and Marion had some of the refreshments in her hands when she came into the room.&nbsp; But at once she forgot about everything but her father.&quot;</p>
<p>Marion was excused from school, and left with the man who would, three days later, end her life.</p>
<p>After the kidnapping, Holt said, &quot;Oh, I can think of many things I could have done now.&nbsp; I never would have let Marion go but for the apparent sincerity and disarming manner of the man.&quot;</p>
<p>Private funeral services for 12-year-old Marion Parker were held today at the Little Church of Flowers at Forest Lawn Cemetery, after which her body was cremated.&nbsp; The search for her killer continues, with police and citizens as far away as Denver and Portland on the lookout for the Fox.</p></div>

<p>December 18, 1927 <br />Los Angeles  </p>
<p>This morning&#8217;s headline was set in the giant typeface reserved for only very good or very bad news. This time it was the latter:  &quot;Kidnaped [sic] Child Slain By Fiend.&quot; For three days now, Angelenos have followed the story of 12-year-old Marian Parker, lured away from Mount Vernon High School by a man who said her father was ill. The kidnapper demanded $1500 (close to $18,000 in 2007) for her safe return, and Marian&#8217;s father agreed to pay it.   </p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lperil/2122206832/" title="The suitcase by peril61, on Flickr"><img loading="lazy" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2346/2122206832_5615e008d8.jpg" width="366" height="336" ALIGN="right" alt="The suitcase" /></a></p>
<p>Shortly after 8 o&#8217;clock last night, the kidnapper drove up to the agreed-upon meeting place. Marian&#8217;s small form was visible in the passenger seat. &quot;Here&#8217;s your child,&quot; he told Parker. &quot;Give me the money and follow instructions. She&#8217;s asleep now.&quot; The ransom changed hands; the criminal drove a short way and deposited Marian&#8217;s blanket-wrapped figure on the lawn at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=432+South+Manhattan+Place,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=66.457072,103.886719&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.06729,-118.310351&#038;spn=0.008674,0.012681&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="Where Marian's body was found">432 South Manhattan Place</a>. Perry Parker rushed to his daughter, scooped her up and&mdash;in a waking nightmare that must have haunted him for the rest of his days&mdash;discovered she was dead, her eyes wired or sewn open in a hideous simulacrum of life. A wire was bound so tightly around her neck that it cut deeply into her flesh; she had been disemboweled and her legs hacked off close to her body. The <em>Times</em> was filled with stories comparing the Parker case to Leopold and Loeb and a host of other grisly child murderers. Crowds of bloodthirsty thrill seekers (the <em>Times</em> estimated over 25,000) thronged past the Parker household at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=1631+South+Wilton+Place&#038;sll=34.06729,-118.310351&#038;sspn=0.008674,0.012681&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.043734,-118.314471&#038;spn=0.008677,0.012681&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="The Parker Family Home">1631 South Wilton Place</a> (address helpfully supplied by the paper).   </p>
<p>The horror continued today. While most of Los Angeles was still reading its morning papers, citizens aiding the police found five gruesome bundles on a lonely road in Elysian Park. The first contained Marian&#8217;s arms and legs; the last, found by &quot;two small boys, carrying on the search,&quot; held her viscera. A blood-soaked suitcase previously discovered in the gutter at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=620+South+Manhattan,+los+angeles&#038;sll=34.063397,-118.31033&#038;sspn=0.008675,0.012681&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.063877,-118.31033&#038;spn=0.008675,0.012681&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="Where the suitcase was found">620 South Manhattan</a> place is believed to have held the child&#8217;s body. Then, late this evening, the police found an abandoned Ford roadster, license number 667-67. It is believed to be the automobile driven by the kidnapper to the meeting with Marian&#8217;s father.   </p>
<p>A massive manhunt is underway for the <a href=" https://markgribben.com/?p=288">fiendish killer</a>.<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lperil/2121428979/" title="A &quot;Grisly Rendezvous of Death&quot; by peril61, on Flickr"><img loading="lazy" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2241/2121428979_34477caed6.jpg" width="500" height="224" alt="A &quot;Grisly Rendezvous of Death&quot;" /></a></a></div>
