<div align="left">Today was a good day to be a bad guy in Los Angeles, and a profitable one, too.&nbsp; Calls to police flooded in from the terrorized, the carjacked, the held-up, and the home invaded, for a total of 16 robberies and 30 burglaries in a single day.</p>
<p>Poor Catherine Schmidt, a clerk at the Van De Camp bakery at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=3601+sunset,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=31.150864,59.765625&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.091727,-118.276899&#038;spn=0.007943,0.014591&#038;z=16&#038;om=0" target="_blank" title="sunset">3601 Sunset</a>, was robbed for the second time in a single week.&nbsp; The scar-faced stick-up man made off with $17, and Catherine recognized him as the same guy who&#8217;d rifled through her register just a few days previous.</p>
<p>Drug store owner Charles A. Elliott had already closed up shop when bandits struck, and was spared the indignity of having a gun waved in his face.&nbsp; However, his safe was cracked and $300 liberated, along with 22 pints of medicinal whiskey.&nbsp; Pharmacy grade &#8212; nice!</p>
<p>John S. Smith was held up at Mulholland and Laurel Canyon, and dragged from his car.&nbsp; When the thugs discovered that Smith didn&#8217;t have any money on him, they swiped his hat and coat and cut his ignition wires.&nbsp; Jack Olonglin was also stranded roadside when a carjacking pair set up a roadblock at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=wilshire+and+yale,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=34.093255,-118.223534&#038;sspn=0.015886,0.029182&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.039876,-118.474653&#038;spn=0.015896,0.029182&#038;z=15&#038;om=0" target="_blank" title="wilshire">Yale and Wilshire</a>, and took $300 and two suitcases of clothing from him before disabling his auto.</p>
<p>K.E. Winters, laundry truck driver, was stalled at Avenue 37 and Dayton when he was set upon by another would-be robber.&nbsp; However, as Winters&nbsp; handed over the money, he whipped up a hard luck story about not being able to cover his bills as it was.&nbsp; His assailant took pity on him, and returned the money, saying, &quot;Oh well.&nbsp; I guess I&#8217;m too soft-hearted to be a bandit anyway.&nbsp; Slip me enought to buy a bed and some eats and I&#8217;ll let you go.&quot;</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t believe that one worked, but nicely played, Mr. Winters.</p></div>
