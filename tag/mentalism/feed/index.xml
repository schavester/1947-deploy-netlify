<p class="MsoNormal">Jan. 15, 2007</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Los Angeles </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">While making <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&#038;item=330075792206&amp;ssPageName=ADME:B:SS:US:1">my daily check of EBay</a>, I found an envelope from 1907 that was an interesting sequel to the &#8220;<a href="https://pensive-torvalds-020d34.netlify.app/an-ebay-mystery-worthy-of-holmes">Mystery of the Burmese Fortunetellers</a>.&#8221; This envelope was addressed to A. Victor Segno, 701 N. Belmont. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A brief check of Proquest revealsÃ¢â‚¬â€whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s this? A major scam artist, self-help author and wife-stealer.</p>
<p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.lmharnisch.com/images/1907_0115A.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 235px; height: 311px;" src="//www.lmharnisch.com/images/1907_0115A.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>    </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A. Victor Segno turns out to be the operator of the American Institute of Mentalism. HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s how it works: Members agree to send Segno $1 ($21.30 USD 2005) a month. In return he sends out a Ã¢â‚¬Å“success waveÃ¢â‚¬Â twice a day. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">According to SegnoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s literature: Ã¢â‚¬Å“The vibrations which Prof. Segno is able to produce in people, through being in harmony with their mentalism, is often felt by them, though thousands of miles distant, as a sensation similar to a slight electric shock.Ã¢â‚¬Â </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And a testimonial: Ã¢â‚¬Å“When I commenced taking the treatments with your club I was full of doubts as to the effects, but as I was anxious to be successful and had little to lose and all to gain I continued to take them. I have been a member less than two months and the following are the results:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ã¢â‚¬Å“At the time I joined the club I was sick, but compelled to work and for very small wages. Shortly after I began to feel better. On the 7<sup>th</sup> of this month my employer sold me his stock of goods on credit. By the 21<sup>st</sup> I had paid $100 on the cost of the stock and on the 24<sup>th</sup> I sold the stock for ($300 or $800) over the cost and reserved an interest in the business.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ã¢â‚¬Å“You no doubt will be glad to learn that since joining your club I have improved in health, supported myself and little baby girl and made over $1,000, and risen from a servant to be a proprietor. I have also secured a position as traveling agent for a Chicago firm at a large salary. It is wonderful to me.Ã¢â‚¬Â </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Busy though he was sending out success waves, Segno was able to write two books: Ã¢â‚¬Å“How to Live 100 YearsÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“How to Be Happy Though Married,Ã¢â‚¬Â available from the institute for $3 each. Later works included Ã¢â‚¬Å“Personal Magnetism,Ã¢â‚¬Â<span style="">  </span>Ã¢â‚¬Å“<a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/A-VICTOR-SEGNO-THE-LAW-OF-MENTALISM-1902-1stEd_W0QQitemZ180063442786QQihZ008QQcategoryZ29223QQrdZ1QQssPageNameZWD1VQQcmdZViewItem">The Law of Mentalism</a>Ã¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“How to Have Beautiful Hair.Ã¢â‚¬Â</p>
<p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.lmharnisch.com/images/1907_0115B.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="//www.lmharnisch.com/images/1907_0115B.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>    </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Apparently Segno did a thriving business because in a few years he was able to plan a large estate at Belmont and Kane, which was featured in The Times. The letter, addressed to 701 N. Belmont, was presumable sent to the institution on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Inspiration PointÃ¢â‚¬Â over Echo Park, although I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t locate it now. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In 1911, however, Segno left Los Angeles, ostensibly to set up a similar school in Russia. Shortly thereafter, his longtime personal secretary, Mrs. Irene Weitzel, a recently married woman whom he had employed since she was a young girl, vanished on an alleged trip to Chicago to visit her parents. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In response to reportersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ questions about whether Segno had run off with his secretary, his wife, Annie Dell Segno,<span style="">  </span>replied: Ã¢â‚¬Å“It isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t true, unless my husband has lost his senses.Ã¢â‚¬Â </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ã¢â‚¬Å“An official of the school admitted that Mrs. Segno is greatly perturbed and admitted that there had been talk about Segno and the girl for some months,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times says. Ã¢â‚¬Å“She said that when such stories came to her ears she had hotly denied them because SegnoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s teaching and life stood out in her mind as everything ideal.Ã¢â‚¬Â</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.lmharnisch.com/images/victor_segnoC.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 360px; height: 187px;" src="//www.lmharnisch.com/images/victor_segnoC.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A. Victor Segno and &#8220;success waves&#8221; in action, from one of his books. Note the beautiful hair. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Divorce eventually followed as Segno set up an identical scheme in Berlin. He returned to the United States about 1915 as the clouds of World War I formed over Europe. Thereafter, Segno vanished from the news while his ex-wife was mentioned in a 1923 story because she had married Harry T. Robinson, apparently a member of a robbery gang. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Thanks, EBay! </p>
