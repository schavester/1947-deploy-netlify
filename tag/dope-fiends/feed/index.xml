<div align="left">February 13, 1927</div>
<div align="left">Chinatown&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left"><img loading="lazy" width="238" height="203" border="0" align="left" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2184/2263112569_bd5cca6f05_o.jpg" alt="dopeslayer" title="dopeslayer" />The headline read, &quot;TORTURE DEN AND POISON PEN OF SUSPECTED DOPE SLAYER BELIEVED FOUND,&quot; and the story itself contained six missing girls, a basement torture chamber, and a &quot;trick&quot; pencil that could turn into hypodermic needle, chock full of poison, with the flick of a finger.</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">The villain was none other than Snow Davis, aka Harry Harpon, aka The Sticker, a dope fiend who&#8217;d done time on poison charges in three state prisons in as many years, and had twice been a murder suspect.</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">It&#8217;s all quite a lot of build-up for a story that ultimately came to nothing.&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">The Chinatown den was discovered when undercover agents heard groans in its vacinity.&nbsp; Their report was passed along to the feds, who prompty raided the joint.&nbsp; In addition to the &quot;poison pencil,&quot; Snow Davis&#8217;s known weapon of choice, they found piles of women&#8217;s clothing and a stack of newspaper clippings from New Orleans.</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">However, any former inhabitants had fled.&nbsp; Investigators had been hoping to link Snow to the January disappearances of six girls between the ages of 15 and 20, but it must have been wishful thinking.</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">Snow Davis, aka Harry Harpon, aka The Sticker, gets out of Los Angeles unscathed, and the <em>Times</em> never mentions him again.&nbsp;</div>
