<p>Bad news ladies &ndash; your feet have grown larger over the past twenty years. The reason? Dancing! Your older female relatives may have danced the night away, but they were tripping the light fantastic to the sedate melodies of the waltz and the two-step. The kinder, gentler dances of bygone days made it possible for women to keep their petite size three tootsies from spreading out like flapjacks. Modern gals stomp around the dance floor gyrating to the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tango_(dance)" title="tango">tango</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Charleston" title="the charleston">Charleston</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_bottom" title="black bottom">black bottom</a>. As a result of all this vigorous activity, today the average girl wears anywhere from four and a half to a size six shoe! </p>
<p>&ldquo;As athletics become more popular for women and modern dances become more violent feet will grow in accordance. Some day women will <img loading="lazy" width="125" height="250" border="0" align="right" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1006/803978280_10a7a063b8_o.jpg" alt="Olive Oyl" title="Olive Oyl" />have feet as large as men&rsquo;s are now&rdquo;, said Mr. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ibdb.com/person.asp?ID=14026" title="Julian Alfred">Julian Alfred</a>, a director of musical choruses at <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM" title="MGM">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a>. </p>

<p><img loading="lazy" width="250" height="197" border="0" align="right" title="standingdead" alt="standingdead" src="//farm1.static.flickr.com/223/503939054_baf7328cef_o.gif" />May 20, 1927<br />Lincoln Heights</p>
<p>Cinema actor <a title="gordonstanding" target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0822057/">Gordon Standing</a>, of noble acting stock, had played Horatio in the &ldquo;Modern Hamlet&rdquo; on the East Coast stage.&nbsp; Back East he&rsquo;d starred in Lasky, Vitagraph, Inspiration and D.W. Griffith film productions.&nbsp;&nbsp; But then he got it into his head to come Out West.&nbsp; Though he&rsquo;d been wounded several times in the Marine Corps during the Big Scrap, nothing could have prepared him for the horrors of Hollywood.</p>
<p>At first, all was well at <a title="seligzoo" target="_blank" href="https://www.lincolnheightsla.com/selig/">Selig</a> <a title="seligII" target="_blank" href="https://employees.oxy.edu/jerry/seligzoo.htm">Zoo</a> <a title="seligstudiowiki" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selig_Polyscope_Company">Studio</a>.&nbsp; Standing&rsquo;d been working alongside his old buddy Elmo &ldquo;<a title="elmolincoln" target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0511104/">First Tarzan</a>&rdquo; Lincoln and a new buddy, one giant lion, in the cheapie serial &ldquo;<a title="KOTJ" target="_blank" href="https://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/K/KingoftheJungle1927.html">King of the Jungle</a>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Apparently Standing had been getting along peachy-like with his new feline friend, until Standing changed his make-up, putting on a beard, and old Leo didn&rsquo;t recognize him.&nbsp; The maned one attacked!&nbsp; It took fifteen men to pull the animal off Standing, who was rushed to Roosevelt Hospital with severe bites and slashes about the neck and shoulders.&nbsp; King of the Jungle was no match for King of the Beasts.&nbsp; (Interestingly, <a title="allmovie" target="_blank" href="https://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&#038;sql=2:67553">allmovie.com</a> would have us believe Standing was trampled by a &quot;rampaging elephant;&quot; perhaps they were thinking of the elephants that graced the entrance to the zoo.)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="360" height="217" border="0" title="elephants" alt="elephants" src="//farm1.static.flickr.com/199/503939878_1b9dfee940_o.gif" /></p>
<p>The Selig Studio had a &quot;jungle area&quot; in which to film, but their lions weren&#8217;t of the perfoming type; the question stands, then, was the rent-a-lion that killed Standing none other than famous snarling L. B. Mayer sidekick Slats, denizen of <a title="gayslionfarm" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay's_Lion_Farm">Gay&rsquo;s Lion Farm</a> (where lions would run amok a mere sixteen months later)?</p>
