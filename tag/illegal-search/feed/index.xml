<p>August 21, 1927<br />Los Angeles  </p>
<p>The voice on the phone was breathless. &quot;Help! Murder! Police!! He&#8217;s killing me, come quick!&quot; (All dialogue, however fanciful, comes verbatim from today&#8217;s <em>Los Angeles Times</em>.) &quot;Be right over,&quot; responded the dispatcher, as he sent two of his &quot;star murder squad officers&quot; to the scene of the crime.   </p>
<p>They were met at the door of <a title="Mrs. Brown's House" target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=1618+East+27th+Street,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=29.081881,59.765625&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.01377,-118.245013&#038;spn=0.007417,0.014591&#038;z=16&#038;om=1">1618 East 27th Street</a> by Mrs. Georgia Brown, who quickly assured them there was nothing out of order at her house. &quot;Must be something wrong somewhere [else], everything&#8217;s running <a href=" http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/according-to-hoyle.html">according to Hoyle</a> here,&quot; she told the officers.  </p>
<p>Then Mrs. Brown made an error, a grievous one, the kind for which you&#8217;ll forever after kick yourself, even if you live to be 100. &quot;Just walk in and see for yourselves,&quot; she said.  </p>
<p>The cops didn&#8217;t need to be asked twice. A five-minute investigation of Mrs. Brown&#8217;s house turned up five bottles of home brew.   Called before the judge on a charge of possessing alcohol, Mrs. Brown was given the choice of a $100 fine or ten days in jail. She chose the former&mdash;though she still believes the police came to the wrong house. </p>
