<p>September 3, 1927 <img loading="lazy" title="Marmola" height="491" alt="Marmola" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1186/1312974404_ebead1c049_o.jpg" width="171" align="right" border="0" /><br />Los Angeles </p>
<p>Not all crimes are reported on the front page &ndash; and not all criminals are gun toting bandits. It may seem like a slow news day, but lurking on page six of the Los Angeles Times was this innocent looking advertisement for the diet drug Marmola. In the future the drug will be exposed as a possible killer! </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hop into the time machine and travel to 1938&#8230; The public was fed up with products that promised the world, but delivered illness, disfigurement, and death. A Senate subcommittee was formed to investigate the outrageous claims of some over the counter medications. Following the subcommittee&rsquo;s recommendations, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act on June 25, 1938. </p>
<p>Attorneys for Marmola challenged the constitutionality of the law. They insisted that people had the, &ldquo;inalienable right of self-medication&rdquo;. The judge who reviewed the case disagreed stating that the legislation was enacted to, &ldquo;make self-medication safer and more effective&rdquo;. Marmola toned down its claims but remained on the market. Finally in the early 1940s the FDA, believing the drug to be dangerous, seized dozens of packets while they were in transit to La Crosse, Wisconsin. The drug went on trial in Madison, Wisconsin in 1943. </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="fat girls" height="240" alt="fat girls" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1024/1312974220_b89e7da837_o.jpg" width="200" align="left" border="0" />A young woman from Chicago came forward with a horror story that left courtroom watchers in tears. She told the judge that she had purchased Marmola because she was tired of her weight being the subject of cruel taunts by her classmates. Her excess pounds began to melt away, but she had also developed some nasty side effects. She hadn&rsquo;t known that she was taking desiccated thyroid in toxic amounts. By the end of seven months she was vomiting regularly and her weight would eventually plummet to a cadaverous 50 pounds! At the time of the trial she was deathly ill with persistent symptoms of <a title="hyperthyroidism" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthyroidism" target="_blank">hyperthyroidism</a>. </p>
<p>Due in large part to the girl&rsquo;s testimony, Marmola was finally pulled from drugstore shelves. </p>
<p>Diet elixirs such as Marmola aren&rsquo;t quaint artifacts of bygone days. Just spend any Saturday morning watching today&rsquo;s television infomercials hawking diet drugs and quack devices, each promising to transform you from a flabby couch potato to a sculpted body beautiful. </p>
<p>Caveat emptor. </p>

<p><img loading="lazy" width="205" height="300" border="0" align="left" title="flw" alt="flw" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1269/1246437393_8d714c93d6_o.gif" />August 26, 1927<br />Madison, Wisc.</p>
<p>Frank Lloyd Wright was a favorite son of Los Angeles, where he threw off the Prairie mantle and began creating his kooky indigenous-flavored block houses (e.g., Storer, Millard, Ennis, Freeman) in contrast to the Spanish Colonial (or, say, Egyptoid Tudor Chateauxesque) prevalent in the Southland&rsquo;s early 20s, before he said to hell with LA and lit out for his cursed home, Taliesin. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There was much architectural buzz about Mr. Wright in 1927, as he&rsquo;d already designed a theater model for Aline Barnsdall, who announced in January that she&rsquo;d build the structure as part of her eight-acre &ldquo;city cultural center&rdquo; gift to Los Angeles of her own FLW <a href="http://www.hollyhockhouse.net/" target="_blank" title="hollyhock">Hollyhock House</a> and property. </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="176" border="0" title="barnsdall" alt="barnsdall" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1341/1246550016_e0a60d670f_o.gif" /></p>
<p>When the Smart People of to-day tour FLW&#8217;s block houses and consider his play of light over form, and gauge its relationship between the zig of Meiji woodblock prints and the zag of Walter Burley Griffin&rsquo;s green thumb, they probably aren&rsquo;t informed that ol&rsquo; FLW had a lurid past fit for any tabloid-worthy favorite son of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>For example, while married to Catherine Wright, he fell in love with another woman, one Mamah Borthwick.&nbsp; Catherine wouldn&rsquo;t divorce him, so Wright abandoned her and the six kids and went galavanting around Europe with Mamah.&nbsp; On his return, Catherine still wouldn&rsquo;t divorce him, so Wright brought scandal to Spring Green, Wisc. by shacking up with Mamah.&nbsp; This was sorted out in short order when one of his domestics decided to utilize a Wrightian architectural principal&mdash;one door for all purposes&mdash;which made it easy to axe-murder seven people trying to flee a Taliesin you&rsquo;d just set on fire.&nbsp; And Mamah was one of those so axed.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Catherine finally divorced Frank in 1922 on charges of desertion, so he could marry his new love, a morphine addict named Miriam Noel.&nbsp; They married in 1923, separated in 1924; Wright began seeing Petrograd Ballet dancer Olgivanna Lazovich Milanov (thirty-three years his junior) in 1925 and was thereafter arrested in 1926 for violating the Mann (White-Slave Traffic) Act.&nbsp; Oh, and Taliesin burned <em>again</em>, though this time without anybody being hacked to bits.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="376" height="251" border="0" title="frankgettingpopped" alt="frankgettingpopped" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1031/1246437375_97ccaf7d7a_o.gif" /><br />Frank getting popped by the feds, 1926&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="209" height="233" border="0" align="right" title="divorce" alt="divorce" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1404/1246550024_073ed04972_o.gif" />The lucky Wright-drama followers of 1927 were treated to tales of Frank and Miriam&rsquo;s divorce.&nbsp; Today, Miriam was awarded $6,000 ($66,179 USD2006) immediately, $30,000 (330,889) in trust, and $250 (2,757) a month for life.&nbsp; The cash settlement and Wright&rsquo;s promise that he &quot;would lead a moral life&quot; preceded the court decree.</p>
<p>With a cushy settlement like that, you&rsquo;d think that&rsquo;s the last we hear of Miss Miriam.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d be wrong.&nbsp; She spends the next few years loudly proclaiming Wright&rsquo;s brutality and repellant morals, with much effort expended in Washington attempting to get Olga deported.&nbsp; In a typical Miriam moment, July 14, 1928, she is arrested on a charge of malicious mischief after breaking <img loading="lazy" width="141" height="300" border="0" align="left" title="miriam" alt="miriam" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1043/1247462700_09c3d5a10e_o.gif" />into FLW&rsquo;s rented La Jolla home while he&rsquo;s up in Los Angeles:&nbsp; &ldquo;So thorough was the wrecking that the colored maid in charge of the house in Wright&rsquo;s absence collapsed from the shock and was taken to the Scripps Memorial Hospital.&nbsp; &lsquo;About fifteen minutes more and I would have leveled the place,&rsquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Wright is said to have told police when arrested&hellip;damage to the La Jolla home is estimated at about $1000&hellip;Mrs. Wright smiling pleaded guilty and following the court action, swore out complaints against her husband and Olga Hinzenberg, also known as Olga Milanoff, charging them with being lewd and dissolute persons.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Miriam finally expires in 1930.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll keep you posted on all breaking FLW news.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d keep an eye on that Schindler character if I were you.&nbsp;</p>
