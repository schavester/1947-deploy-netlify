<div><img loading="lazy" width="299" height="500" border="0" align="left" src="//farm1.static.flickr.com/198/454405659_3a08c79ff0.jpg" alt="vivianthecow" title="vivianthecow" />Accused of stealing four cows from Lancaster rancher J.L. Armstrong, Percy Sweet, Samuel Thomason, and Chalice Thomason first came to trial early in 1927.&nbsp; Due to some uncertainty about the physical appearance of the stolen cows, however, the jury was unable to reach a verdict&nbsp;for the suspected cattle rustlers. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Deputy District Attorney Ryan then&nbsp;convinced Judge Stephens that he could have moved&nbsp;the jurors&nbsp;to a conviction had they&nbsp;gotten to see&nbsp;the cows for themselves. &nbsp;When the defendants&#8217; attorney, Guy Eddie, refused to accept photographs of the stolen cattle as evidence in the retrial, Ryan retorted, &quot;Then we will produce the cow in court.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Stephens signed an order commanding one of the cows to appear as a silent witness in the grand larceny trial.&nbsp; Why the cow was to be listed as a witness for the state, rather than evidence, is anyone&#8217;s guess.</p>
<p>And so, Vivian, one of the abducted cows, appeared with her calf in the Hall of Justice on April 11.&nbsp; The bovine witness was unwilling to take a freight elevator to the courtroom, so the jurors came to her, and court reconvened in the Hall&#8217;s basement.&nbsp;&nbsp; While on the stand, Vivian made nice with Judge Stephens by&nbsp;licking his ear, prompting Guy Eddie to joke, &quot;I protest!&nbsp; It is apparent that the witness is trying to reach the judge.&quot; </p>
<p>In the end, Ryan&#8217;s strategy seems to have been effective.&nbsp; The Thomason brothers were sentenced to San Quentin for 1-10 years, while Sweet received five years probation on May 23, 1927.</p></div>
