<p>April 8, 1907<br />
Los Angeles</p>
<p>R. Crawford Smith, a wealthy Cincinnati bachelor who died in February, aged 61, spent the past several years living amongst strangers in Los Angeles. For a long while, he called the Hotel Melrose on Grand Avenue his home, and more recently had lived with familes on McClintock Avenue and South Olive Street.</p>
<p>His two brothers, William E. and A. Denniston Smith, have come from the east after Crawford&#8217;s death to inquire how it is that his will, which was to have split his $100,000 fortune equally between them and two sisters, acquired late codiciles leaving $17,000 to three females, rumored to be practictioners of Spiritualism, all residents of this city. The Smiths have hired Attorney Charles Cassat Davis to handle the challenge.</p>
<p>E.Z. Barrett, husband of the woman willed $10,000, says his wife Dora befriended a sad old man, and was repaid for her kindness with the posthumous gift. Mediumship had nought to do with it&#8211;though Dora is a popular lecturer on the subject, who has been known to give public demonstrations of her ability to commune with those who have &#8220;passed over.&#8221; Mr. Barrett stresses however that Dora is not a medium of the typical type.</p>
<p>Pasadena high school teacher Miss Lottie Livingston was willed $5000 from the Smith coffers, and Mrs. Lola Swilling, whose husband is said to be an Army officer stationed in Cuba, has a $2000 gift promised her.</p>
<p>Smith&#8217;s few local friends recall him as a lonesome, ill and melancholy man, a believer in Spiritualism who sought out Mrs. Barrett and frequently visited her home in his last days, apologizing for being a burden but saying how much he appreciated being among friends.</p>
<p>The late man&#8217;s estate was largely held in property, including a hotel at the southeast corner of <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=S+Hope+St+%26+W+6th+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90017&amp;ll=34.050313,-118.256364&amp;spn=0.015076,0.041757" target="_blank">Hope and Sixth Streets</a> here.</p>
