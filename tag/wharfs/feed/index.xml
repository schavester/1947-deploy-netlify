<p>August 2, 1907<br />San Pedro</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="333" height="230" border="0" align="left" src="//static.flickr.com/67/204670383_7048163aba_o.gif" alt="longwharf" title="longwharf" />The great wharfs and piers of Los Angeles are by and large but a thing of memory.&nbsp; Who cannot tilt a head in wonder as one motors up PCH past the State Historic Landmark signage for the Port of Los Angeles Long Wharf, designating it &ldquo;site of&rdquo; the longest wooden pier in the world?<br /><img loading="lazy" width="369" height="224" border="0" align="right" src="//static.flickr.com/58/204670423_58f934036c_o.gif" alt="pedrowharf" title="pedrowharf" /><br />It was dismantled after San Pedro became our official harbor in 1897.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Ten years later, on this day, while the wharf was under construction, stout men were busy pulling bodies from the briny Pedro deep.</p>
<p>Seems that trainmen ran heavily-loaded cars onto the trackless uncompleted portion, causing 365 feet of trestle work to collapse, crushing Bakko Kovavich and drowning three others&mdash;Melia Bolich and Miko Kovavich.&nbsp; Where Native Americans famously built our skyscrapers, it would appear that Greeks built our piers.</p>
<p>Remember these men when next you enjoy the fruits of our port system.</p>
