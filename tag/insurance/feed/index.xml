<p><img loading="lazy" width="242" height="113" border="0" align="left" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1064/542998855_eecc73c3fc_o.jpg" alt="houdini" title="houdini" />Famed illusionist Harry Houdini died October 31, 1926, but until today, his widow, Bess, didn&#8217;t know whether she&#8217;d see any of the insurance money.&nbsp; After months of investigation, the New York Life Insurance Company decided to accept the claim that Houdini died as the result of a blow struck by J. Gordon Whitehead, a McGill University student.&nbsp; Bess Houdini would receive a settlement of $25,000 ($296,962 USD 2007).</div>
<div align="left">Of course, New York Life had good reason to be confused.&nbsp; Even today, Houdini&#8217;s death is surrounded by uncertainty.&nbsp; Some accounts say that Whitehead challenged Houdini to take the punch fair and square, while others claim that he and his buddies lambasted the illusionist while he reclined on a sofa.&nbsp; According to some, the blow to the abdomen could have ruptured Houdini&#8217;s appendix, while others today say that this would only have aggravated a pre-existing condition.&nbsp; Still others speculate that he was actually poisoned by the angry Spiritualists he&#8217;d discredited.&nbsp; As recently as March of this year, Harry&#8217;s descendents were seeking to have the body exhumed, while Bess&#8217;s sought to block it, claiming that the whole thing reeked of a book promotion stunt.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s a humble claims adjuster to do?</p></div>
