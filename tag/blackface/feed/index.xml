<p>August 2, 1927<br />Hollywood&nbsp;</p>
<p>A line stretched halfway down the block from the lobby of the Pantages Theater as eager fans waited their chance to be amused by Moran and Mack, popular blackface performers better known as Two Black Crows. Once they got inside, the audience enjoyed such trifles as a man who played Liszt on the banjo, a tap dancing sister act and the great Van Cello, who balances barrels on his feet. </p>
<p>Moran and Mack were a great hit, and indulged the cheering crowd with two skits, a comic boxing match and Mack&#8217;s signature &quot;lazy shuffle.&quot; The evening closed with a screening of <em>Colleen</em> starring Madge Bellamy, in which Irish people were painted with a brush nearly as broad as the tar-dipped one that coats Two Black Crows. Just another night of fun and frolic in Movietown USA! &nbsp;</p>
