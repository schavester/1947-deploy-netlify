<p>Archie Howell had a flair for the dramatic. &nbsp;</p>
<p>He and his wife divorced after two years of marriage, she awarded her $115 a-month alimony.&nbsp; Howell had gone to see his erstwhile love at their home, but she refused to see him.</p>
<p>Later Howell was in his auto and saw his wife on the street.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come on over to the car, honey, I want to give you some money&rdquo; he chirped. &nbsp; The former Mrs. Howell strode over and leaned in, at which point Mr. Howell shot himself in the head.</p></div>
