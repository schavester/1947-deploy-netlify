<p>Welcome, gentle reader, to the new and much-improved 1947project blog. After one full year blogging the crimes and oddities of 1947 Los Angeles, we begin Anno 2 by leaving behind the clunky primitivism of Blogger (no categories? no tags? single RSS feeds? come <em>on!</em>) for the cutting edge power of the <a href="http://www.dumplingfeed.com/" target="_blank">Dumplingfeed</a> engine (thanks, Richard!). </p>
<p>The biggest change you&#8217;ll notice is the inclusion of our longtime king of comments <a href="http://lmharnisch.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Larry Harnisch</a> to the official roster of 1947project bloggers. He brings extraordinary depth as a researcher, a sly wit, and a propensity for remixing historical content into intriguing new media. Welcome, Larry, to the front page! </p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s the little matter of subject. Since I started this blog last March, people have been asking Nathan and myself: what comes after you finish the year? Will you start in on 1948, or something totally different? Nathan goofed at a party that the next year might be 1923, which was picked up by <a href="http://www.laobserved.com/archive/2005/12/first_thing_wednesday_122.html" target="_blank">LAObserved</a>. Sorry about the faux-scoop, Kevin&#8211;we actually had yet to decide what came next when Nathan set his gums to flapping. </p>
<p>Well, if you&#8217;ve found this URL in advance of Tuesday&#8217;s official changeover, we feel you deserve a little insider information. As hinted broadly in Larry&#8217;s horsey video below, we are about to plunge into the strange and fascinating year <strong>1907</strong>. </p>
<p>Our initial research has shown us a Los Angeles that is deeply unfamiliar, despite the streets whose names we know. The locals were strange, the newspapers florid, and money flowed like wine. We look forward to exploring this year with you, and to learning more about a Los Angeles that seems very different from any of the versions of the city we feel we know.</p>
<p>The new site features cross-referencing by types of crime and by neighborhood, so readers can delve into subjects that most interest them without having to follow a strictly chronological path. We&#8217;ve added tags (a sort of keyword), adding additional organizational data to each post. </p>
<p>Readers may, if they wish, subscribe to any search result by clicking the little orange XML button that appears on the bottom of any page. Want to know whenever someone gets <a href="http://www.47upgradepath7.richardschave.com//taxonomy/term/41/0/feed" target="_blank">poisoned</a> or <a href="http://www.47upgradepath7.richardschave.com//taxonomy/term/37/0/feed" target="_blank">tossed out a window</a>? Use a feedreader like <a href="http://bloglines.com/" target="_blank">Bloglines</a> and subscribe to the appropriate feed, and you&#8217;ll be kept up to date. Or <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/1947project" target="_blank">subscribe to the full feed</a> for every little thing we publish.</p>
<p>So hop into the Wayback Machine, gentle reader, and join your hosts Kim, Nathan and Larry as we touch down in a very weird and wonderful Los Angeles. We&#8217;re still called 1947project, but out the window it&#8217;s 1907&#8230; and we can&#8217;t wait to show you around!&nbsp;</p>
