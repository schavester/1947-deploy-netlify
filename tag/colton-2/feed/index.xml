<p>August 29, 1907<br />Colton  </p>
<p>An augur came to Mrs. John George last night as she meandered through the <em>traumwelt</em>, delivering the most terrible of presage:  murder!  The prognostication was that of her husband, Mr. George, standing over the bed.  Choking her.</p>
<p>But Mr. George, long locked up in the secure confines of the State Hospital for the Insane at Patton, was certainly no threat.  Or was he?  On the strength of this omen, she fled her home.  </p>
<p>Mr. George had in fact escaped.  Not finding her at their San Bernadino home, he went late in the night to the home of her parents, and then to Colton, where one of his little boys was staying with an aunt.  Before he could gain ingress, the bulls caught up to the fugitive, and threw him in prison.  </p>
<p>This morning, Mr. George, having torn off his clothes and soaked them in water, and having ripped apart the mattress and bed quilts, fought violently the attempts of the attendants whose job it was to pack him up and ship him back to Patton.  </p>
<p>That Mrs. George will sleep soundly tonight is of course a matter of conjecture, but we hope she does, lest she miss another harbinger from the other side.  </p>

<div>May 4, 1907<br />
Riverside</p>
<p>Jesus Chavez was traveling from his home in El Monte to Colton, where he intended to celebrate Cinco de Mayo.  During the trip Chavez was under the intoxicating influence of liquor continuously, and for reasons unknown shot and killed one Veranze Mansibai on a lonely road near West Riverside.  </p>
<p>Chavez went into hiding, but Sheriff Wilson and Under Sheriff Evans eventually encountered his spring wagon.  A little further on they found the white and bay horses he was driving.  And a little after that, the tiny cabin in which Chavez was tightly holed up, continuing his alcoholiday.</p>
<p>There is little hope Chavez will be able to answer to the charges before the effects of his spree wear off.
