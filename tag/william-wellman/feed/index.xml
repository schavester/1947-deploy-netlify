<p>November 8, 1927<br />Los Angeles</p>
<p>Oddities around town:</p>
<p>World class crumb-bum Joseph Peck returned from a trip to Fort Worth only to discover he was to be made an example by the City Council, seeking to alleviate the costs associated with relief payments provided to mothers whose husbands refused to support their families. Blanche Peck, 42, of 2939 West Avenue 37, has been raising five children, ages 1 to 11, without any help from Joseph since December 1925. Now she&#8217;ll be guaranteed $2 a day for a year. That&#8217;s Papa Joe&#8217;s pay for pounding on L.A.&#8217;s new rock pile. </p>
<p>In Griffith Park, camera operator <a href="http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0794391/" target="_blank">Clifford Shirpser</a> was shooting an exploding airplane for a new William Wellman picture when he stumbled over a stone and went ass over teakettle. The heavy camera went up, then brained the fallen technician. He came to after fifteen minutes. (Shirpser was likely shooting additional footage for <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0018578/" target="_blank"><em>Wings,</em></a> which had debuted in New York in August, but which did not receive its Los Angeles premiere until January 1928.)</p>
<p>And wee, noisy Ill Ill the &quot;untamed, tree-climbing pygmy&quot; barker, recently arrested in front of the Dreamland Palace at 539 South Main Street, copped a guilty plea for violating the city&#8217;s anti-ballyhoo ordinance on two occasions, and paid $100 in fines, thus avoiding a tree-free stint in the Lincoln Heights callaboose.</p>
