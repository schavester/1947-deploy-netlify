</span><span style="font-size:100%;">Los Angeles<br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;">Charles Edward Abbott, 23,  of Artesia had lived his entire life in California without seeing snow except on faraway mountains and suggested that Mabel Carter, 28,  and her father, Henry, 63, join him on a trip to Cucamonga Canyon.<br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;">The Carters, who once owned a grocery story at 10th Street and Alvarado before moving to Ontario, and Abbott went to Cucamonga, expecting to spend several days there.<br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;">During their stay, they ate a can of pork and beans that had been purchased in September and stored with other provisions in a commissary box under an orange tree in the yard outside the cabin.<br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;">Henry Carter was the first to fall ill. Assuming some other cause, he encouraged his daughter and Abbott to take a hike while he stayed behind. They were too ill to go far, however, and returned to the cabin, where they ate another can of pork and beans.<br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;">The three victims returned to the Carter home in Ontario. Mabel  Carter was the first to die, tended by Abbott, who was next, followed by Henry Carter.<br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;">Four physicians attending the victims were unable to explain what killed them. </div>
