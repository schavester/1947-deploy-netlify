<p>April 2, 1927<br />Los Angeles</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="248" height="298" border="0" align="left" title="tonyheadline" alt="tonyheadline" src="//farm1.static.flickr.com/191/443123163_016750b56f_o.gif" />On this Spring day in 1927, investigating officers were pavement-pounding in the Italian neighborhoods, attempting to scare up information about the April Fool&rsquo;s Day discovery of one murdered Antonio (Tony) Ferraro.&nbsp; But there was no talking to be had, and the crime scene revealed nothing in the way of tell-tale fingerprints or any such evidence, and so Tony Ferraro remains another unsolved Los Angeles gangland slaying.</p>
<p>Tony Ferraro was 34, married, and an erstwhile bootlegger.&nbsp; He had given up the bootlegging game back in January when officers knocked out his elaborate still at <a title="sotobootlegging" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=532+S+Soto+St,+Los+Angeles,+California+90033&#038;layer=&#038;sll=34.038791,-118.213105&#038;sspn=0.008855,0.020664&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=16&#038;ll=34.038791,-118.213105&#038;spn=0.008855,0.020664&#038;om=1&#038;iwloc=addr">532 South Soto St</a>.&nbsp; Thereafter he had gone into the olive oil business&#8211;the evening of March 31 he set out from his home at <a title="ferraroshome" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=2724+Cincinnati+St,+Los+Angeles,+Los+Angeles,+California+90033,+United+States&#038;layer=&#038;sll=34.046081,-118.20317&#038;sspn=0.008854,0.020664&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=16&#038;ll=34.046081,-118.20317&#038;spn=0.008854,0.020664&#038;om=1&#038;iwloc=addr">2724 Cincinnati St.</a> with six one-gallon cans of the unctuous stuff (only to return for his funeral a week later).&nbsp; On the morning of April 1 a passerby&rsquo;s attention was attracted by the stream of blood pouring forth from the back seat of Ferraro&rsquo;s Studebaker, parked at <a title="ferrarobodydump" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=659+Kohler+St,+Los+Angeles,+California+90021&#038;layer=&#038;sll=34.038329,-118.241837&#038;sspn=0.008855,0.020664&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=17&#038;ll=34.038196,-118.241837&#038;spn=0.004428,0.010332&#038;om=1&#038;iwloc=addr">659 Kohler St</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="356" height="400" border="0" align="right" title="ferraroandwife" alt="ferraroandwife" src="//farm1.static.flickr.com/159/444243163_855f37d0eb_o.gif" />Robbery was not the motive, as Ferraro&rsquo;s diamond ring, watch, money clip and olive oil were unmolested.&nbsp; Persons unknown entered Ferraro&rsquo;s car, where he was beaten with a tire iron (his bruised hands indicating he put up a strong fight) and then shot in the head once with a .38 and twice with a .32.&nbsp; The body was then pulled from the front seat and lain across the olive oil in the back.</p>
<p>Ferraro was a <a title="matranga" target="_blank" href="https://www.onewal.com/w-matran.html">Matranga</a> relative and Los Angeles bootlegger who had had some problems with his business partners.&nbsp; In September of 1925, someone dynamited a vacant two-story building Ferraro owned at <a title="building" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=2729+N+Main+St,+Los+Angeles,+Los+Angeles,+California+90031,+United+States&#038;layer=&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;sll=34.038196,-118.241837&#038;sspn=0.008855,0.013626&#038;z=16&#038;ll=34.066294,-118.213792&#038;spn=0.008852,0.020664&#038;om=1&#038;iwloc=addr">2729 North Main</a>; eight months later the home of his cousin, Victor Pepitone, <a title="pepitoneexplosion" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=317+w+77th,+la,+ca&#038;sll=34.066294,-118.213792&#038;sspn=0.008852,0.020664&#038;layer=&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=16&#038;ll=33.970129,-118.278637&#038;spn=0.008862,0.020664&#038;om=1&#038;iwloc=addr">317 West 77th St.</a>, was dynamited; five months thereafter the home of Jim Mussacci, Ferraro&rsquo;s business partner, <a title="675lamar" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=675+Lamar+St,+Los+Angeles,+Los+Angeles,+California+90031,+United+States&#038;layer=&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;sll=33.970129,-118.278637&#038;sspn=0.017724,0.027251&#038;z=16&#038;ll=34.065636,-118.223104&#038;spn=0.008852,0.020664&#038;om=1&#038;iwloc=addr">675 Lamar St.</a>, was destroyed in a dynamite explosion.&nbsp; The news from April 2 hints that Ferraro may have recently talked to authorities and implicated two former liquor trade associates, resulting in their arrest, but that clue went nowhere.&nbsp; Attempts to quiz the widow Constance resulted in her continued protestations that Tony had no enemies anywhere.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="350" height="227" border="0" align="left" title="ferraroscar" alt="ferraroscar" src="//farm1.static.flickr.com/228/444289097_9f1767f950_o.gif" />On April 5 the Times reported a rumor that Ferraro&rsquo;s car had been seen the night of the 31st in <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&#038;hl=en&#038;saddr=2724+Cincinnati+St,+Los+Angeles,+California+90033&#038;daddr=800+N+Alameda+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90012+to:659+kohler,+la,+ca&#038;mrcr=0,1&#038;layer=&#038;sll=34.040569,-118.222504&#038;sspn=0.035419,0.054502&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=14&#038;ll=34.047753,-118.222504&#038;spn=0.035416,0.054502&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="ferrarosride">Chinatown between when he set off from home at 6 p.m. and when the car was first spotted at 10 p.m. at Sixth and Kohler</a>, but placing the killing in Chinatown didn&rsquo;t make solving the murder any more possible or probable.&nbsp; That day Ferraro was released from the Coroner&rsquo;s to his home once more; the cinematic mind must imagine properly florid gangland sendoff, with bouquets from those Wright Act violators Tony double-crossed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And up in heaven, the special cloud reserved for unsolved LA homicide victims&mdash;Harry Katz there waiting with a martini&mdash;added one more.</p>
