<p>June 25, 1927<br />Monterey Park</p>
<p>The latest version of the old riddle, <a title="Chicken Crosses Road" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_did_the_chicken_cross_the_road?" target="_blank">&ldquo;Why did the chicken cross the road&rdquo;</a>, debuted today in Judge P.F. Guaiano&rsquo;s courtroom. It fell flat. </p>
<p>While cruising his regular beat in the hills south of <a title="Monterey Park" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=monterey+park,+ca&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=13&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">Monterey Park</a>, Officer T.J. Neal eyeballed&nbsp;some shady looking characters in an automobile. The lawman resolved to have a look, and after further investigation he discovered three men, a decapitated chicken and three empty sacks with feathers stuck to them.&nbsp; Arriving at the obvious conclusion that the poultry had been pinched, Neal demanded an explanation for the beheaded bird. The suspects related a story so improbable it left the cop scratching his head in disbelief. </p>
<p>According to the men, Yeacio Tavary of <a title="Downey" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=downey,+ca&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=12&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">Downey</a>, Isa Magana of <a title="Belvedere Gardens" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=belvedere+park+los+angeles&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677071&#038;sspn=34.587666,86.396484&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.039165,-118.161864&#038;spn=0.008837,0.021093&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">Belvedere</a>, and Daniel Garcia of <a title="Los Angeles" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=los+angeles,+ca&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=9&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">Los Angeles</a>, they had been out for a drive when they spied a headless chicken running amok through the countryside. Imagine their surprise when, without warning, the frenzied fowl dashed up to their car and jumped in!</p>
<p>What were they to do? The bird possessed no identification, which ruled out returning it to its rightful owner. After a brief confab, the trio had decided to keep the bird and had been on their way to cook the obliging entree when they were rousted.</p>
<p>Officer Neal hadn&rsquo;t believed the fantastic tale of the hitchhiking chicken, and apparently neither had Judge Guaiano who mused &ldquo;Chickens are not that foolish&rdquo;, and ordered the defendants to spend ten days in the slammer.</p>
