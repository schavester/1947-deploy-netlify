<p>September 14, 1927</p>
<p>The ballroom of the Biltmore Hotel is being readied for the annual Southern California Dahlia Society exhibition, which is last year drew 7000 people. There&#8217;s just something about the Biltmore that attracts <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Short" target="_blank">Dahlias</a>, and Dahlia lovers.</p>
<p>In Nice, France, San Francisco girl Isadora Duncan &#8212; that free spirit danseuse whose corsetless physique and offbeat theories of health, movement and social mores made her at once the darling and the shame of thousands&nbsp; &#8212; perished in a grisly accident when her long scarf became entangled in the wheel of an open automobile. Duncan was pulled into the road, and died instantly of a broken neck. She was 50.</p>
<p>The fateful scarf was a gift of Mary Desti, Duncan&#8217;s dear friend and the mother of director Preston Sturges, who would go on to invent many a fascinating, madcap female in his motion pictures.</p>
<p>In Medford, Mass., Elizabeth Short, who will be remembered as the Dahlia of the Biltmore long after the flower show is forgotten, is three.</p>
