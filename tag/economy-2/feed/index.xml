<p>June 25, 1927<br />Los Angeles</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="197" height="240" border="0" align="right" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1088/623181919_c0e174615e_m.jpg" alt="Johnston car" title="Johnston car" /></p>
<p>Mr. H. Johnston has just completed a nine day journey along the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Old_Trails_Highway" title="Old Trails Hwy">National Old Trails Highway</a> from Los Angeles to Philadelphia. Amazingly, he made the cross-country trip in his $10 dollar 1919 Ford! His total expenses, including gasoline, meals, lodging, and one minor $3 repair to the Ford was a miserly $55 ($657.31 USD 2007). </p>
<p>Impressive? Absolutely! But, future dwellers, while we shake our heads in wonderment at how inexpensive it was to live in 1927 America, let&rsquo;s put on our time travel goggles and look at this feat&nbsp;from a different perspective.</p>
<p>If Mr. H. Johnston went out today and purchased an entry level 2007 Toyota&nbsp;Prius ($22,175.00)&nbsp;it would cost him $265,015.46 in 1927 dollars. Gasoline for the hybrid would take a bite out of his budget to the tune of about $35.83 per gallon! </p>
<p>Nine nights at a Motel 6 (at $69.99 per night) would set Mr. Johnston back a whopping $7,528.14. And that&rsquo;s if he didn&rsquo;t rent any movies. At these prices he may lose his appetite, but a man has to eat. Let&rsquo;s give Mr. Johnston a total food budget of $45 to visit a drive-thru of his choice once each day &ndash; that translates into $537.80 in current dollars for burgers, fries and sodas. </p>
<p>Get out your calculators and we&rsquo;ll do a back-of-the-envelope&nbsp;estimate for Mr. Johnston&rsquo;s trek in the strange 2007 time machine. The nine day vacation would now cost him approximately $275,052.25. </p>
<p>Your mileage may vary. </p>
