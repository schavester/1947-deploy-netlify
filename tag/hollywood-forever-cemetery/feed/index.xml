<div align="left"><img loading="lazy" width="193" height="240" border="0" align="left" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1035/981433297_ba472220ff_m.jpg" alt="junemathis" title="junemathis" /></div>
<div align="left">When Rudolph Valentino died without a burial plot, one of Hollywood&#8217;s most powerful women, screenwriter June Mathis, stepped up and volunteered space in her own crypt in the Cathedral Mausoleum at what is now the <a href="https://www.hollywoodforever.com/Hollywood/" target="_blank" title="hollywoodforever">Hollywood Forever Cemetery</a>.</p>
<p>Mathis had &quot;discovered&quot; Valentino, literally plucking him from a chorus of extras to star in her <em>Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse</em> in 1921.&nbsp; The two adored one another, though their friendship suffered a rocky period after Valentino was critical of one of her treatments.&nbsp; However, the good friends were reconciled at the Los Angeles premiere of <em>The Son of the Shiek</em>, shortly before Valentino&#8217;s death in August 1926.</p>
<p>As Valentino&#8217;s body was interred, Mathis supposedly said, &quot;Rudy, you can stay there until they place me in it.&quot;</p>
<p>Sadly, this turned out to be a little sooner than anyone had expected.&nbsp; While attending a play in New York City on July 26, 1927, Mathis suffered a fatal heart attack.&nbsp; Her body was transported by train to Los Angeles, just as Valentino&#8217;s had been less than a year before.</p></div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">Today, Valentino&#8217;s former agent announced that his body would be moved from Mathis&#8217;s crypt and into the space reserved for her husband, Italian cinematographer Silvano Balboni.&nbsp; Mathis&#8217;s body was laid to rest on August 5, and rests there next to Valentino to this day.</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">Harry Carr wrote of Mathis in his Lancer column, &quot;June Mathis, who died suddenly in a New York theatre, had one of the finest motion picture minds ever connected with the industry.&nbsp; Perhaps it is just as important that she was one of the kindest, most generous, most thoughtful women who ever breathed.&quot;</div>
