Riverside</p>
<p>Jesus Chavez was traveling from his home in El Monte to Colton, where he intended to celebrate Cinco de Mayo.  During the trip Chavez was under the intoxicating influence of liquor continuously, and for reasons unknown shot and killed one Veranze Mansibai on a lonely road near West Riverside.  </p>
<p>Chavez went into hiding, but Sheriff Wilson and Under Sheriff Evans eventually encountered his spring wagon.  A little further on they found the white and bay horses he was driving.  And a little after that, the tiny cabin in which Chavez was tightly holed up, continuing his alcoholiday.</p>
<p>There is little hope Chavez will be able to answer to the charges before the effects of his spree wear off.
