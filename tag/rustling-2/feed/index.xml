Dist.-Atty. Collins produced the fifteen empty sacks that Mr. Little had in tow; the court estimated these sacks would likely hold fifteen hundred pounds of the bewitching fruit, and further determined that these be worth more than the lowest grand larceny charge of $200.</p>
<p>All that notwithstanding, it was declared at the hearing that Little came quite close to being caught in a bear trap.</p>

<p>May 10, 1927<br />Santa Ana</p>
<p>Then as now, avocados are expensive and desirable treats, and a produce man will find his business flourishing when his expenses are limited to gasoline for midnight raids on Orange County orchards and bullets for his gun. </p>
<p>But the men of the Avocado Grower&#8217;s Association breathe easier tonight after the arrest of Louis Chiuma at his produce stand at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=2301+W+1st+St,+Santa+Ana,+Orange,+California+92703,+United+States&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=58.99189,105.644531&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;cd=3&#038;ll=33.746645,-117.899995&#038;spn=0.007672,0.012896&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">2301 West First Street.</a> Chiuma and his associates are believed to be among the gangs of alligator pear snatchers who have absconded with $50,000 worth of the fruit so far this year. Recently, two men raided the Lindauer Ranch in La Habra and dropped their sacks to engage the night watchman in a gunfight. No one was hit, and the guard reported their truck license to County Sheriffs, which led them to Chiuma.</p>
<p>Back in the suspect&#8217;s rooms, sheriffs found a stash of dynamite. But what they couldn&#8217;t find was a snitch: the neighborhood clammed up quick, with some souls heard muttering about the Black Hand. That&#8217;s right: the Avocado Mafia, and don&#8217;t let me hear you tattling, or there&#8217;ll be no guacamole on your enchilada tonight or ever!</p>
