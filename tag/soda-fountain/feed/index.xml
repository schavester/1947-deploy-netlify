<p>April 5, 1927<br />Santa Monica</p>
<p>Serial burglar E.M. Peterson is presently cooling his heels in Santa Monica Jail, having carelessly cooled his tonsils in the course of knocking over the <a target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=5440+west+washington+street,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=56.200193,104.941406&#038;layer=&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=16&#038;ll=34.039965,-118.361614&#038;spn=0.007272,0.01281&#038;om=1&#038;iwloc=addr">Radio Pharmacy</a> on Washington Boulevard recently. Fingerprint man Barlow discovered an incriminating imprint on a silver sundae cup at the soda fountain, and when confronted with the stain, Peterson admitted both to stealing an icy cold confection, and to no less than fifty Westside burglaries and seventy in Los Angeles. This is once again, proof positive that between meal snacks are bad for a bad man&#8217;s health.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="135" height="240" border="0" align="left" src="//farm1.static.flickr.com/248/447427096_4e617cbd0b_m.jpg" />But enough about crime. Please join us, gentle reader, in wishing a most joyous 95th birthday to the beaming gentleman at left, Mr. Harry Cooper, my grandpa. Born in Philly in 1912, he served in Havai&#8217;i (as he pronounces it) during the early 1930s where he saved a fellow soldier from a riptide, came out to LA and drove a pickle truck, met and wooed my grandma Barbara on the tennis courts, and together they briefly ran a chicken ranch, then were for many years in the discount shoe business at the Beverly Bootery, a shop located where the El Coyote parking lot is today. Harry is a gentle fellow with a passion for tinkering in his garage workshop (ask him about his moss topiary projects or the steering wheel shelf he made so he can read National Geographics in the car while Barbara is shopping), odd scientific and natural history facts, golfing and exotic foods. Here&#8217;s wishing a perfect day to a lovely fellow!&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
