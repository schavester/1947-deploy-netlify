<p>When the doc refused to keep things quiet after treating oilman Grover Lawler&#8217;s (happily superficial) bullet wounds at his home in the Dickerson apartments at Berendo and Beverly, Lawler told visiting cops that he&#8217;d shot himself. No, he would not produce the weapon. Damn, won&#8217;t you flatfoots let a guy recuperate in peace?</p>
<p><a title="Grauman Court apartments, Melrose &#038; Kenmore by richardschave, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/2206685545/"><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="388" border="0" alt="Grauman Court apartments, Melrose &#038; Kenmore" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2224/2206685545_4b6a1fc61c.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Not so fast, Grover. You wouldn&#8217;t know anything about reports that a hysterical blond woman armed with a .38 had fired wildly at a car bearing two men and a woman tonight, just six blocks from your place, at the Grauman Court apartments at <a target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;saddr=4428+Melrose,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;daddr=berendo+and+beverly,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=34.09816,-118.28956&#038;sspn=0.00741,0.014205&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.08078,-118.295696&#038;spn=0.007411,0.014205&#038;t=h&#038;z=16&#038;om=0">4428 Melrose</a>? No? Because G.A. Hessman, resident, has described the incident thoroughly, and turned over the gun that the woman threw into the grass at his feet when she was finished.</p>
<p>Grover reconsidered, and admitted some dizzy dame had shot at him as his party left a dinner engagement at the Melrose address, but refused the identify his assailant. Perhaps recognizing that Mrs. Lawler, now playing nurse, would provide better punishment than the law allowed, the officers went on their way.</p>
