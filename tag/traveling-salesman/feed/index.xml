<p>Seems a traveling sewing machine salesman dropped by Mrs. L.K. Sitton&#8217;s home at 1004 Electric Avenue and, when she complained of a slight headache, mentioned that he was an expert in Swedish massage and offered to relieve her. </p>
<p>The Times reported that &quot;He fled&#8230; when his victim screamed and her husband returned unexpectedly.&quot; Though we wonder if perhaps things didn&#8217;t happen <em>quite</em> in that order.</p>
<p>In any event, Robert S. Harrell, 41, was arrested at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&#038;hl=en&#038;saddr=1004+electric+avenue,+venice,+ca&#038;daddr=sixth+and+san+juan,+venice,+ca&#038;sll=33.994167,-118.471606&#038;sspn=0.007241,0.012381&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=17&#038;om=1" target="_blank">San Juan and Sixth Avenue</a> on charges of attempting an attack on the lady. </p>
