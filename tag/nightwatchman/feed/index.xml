<p>March 18, 1907<br /> Los Angeles&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="129" height="254" border="0" align="left" src="//static.flickr.com/34/114502149_fe1d8ee284_o.jpg" />Carlos Perez, an unarmed man shot by an <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=olvera+street,+Los+Angeles,+CA&#038;ll=34.058455,-118.237352&#038;spn=0.016284,0.04004" target="_blank">Olvera Street</a> nightwatchman as he walked towards his home on Macy Street last evening, lies tonight in County Hospital, gravely wounded with a bullet puncuring his lung. A gruesome side effect of his injury is that air is seeping beneath his skin, inflating his body like a fleshy balloon. Doctors can press gently on the man&#8217;s hands, eyelids and ribcage, causing him to briefly deflate, though he quickly swells up again.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Dr. Barber, the hospital superintendent, says that he has seen victims who suffer minor inflation around their injuries, but never someone whose entire body becomes so like a balloon. Doctors hesitate to puncture Perez&#8217; skin for fear of introducing an infection, and so the poor man suffers the strange sensation of constant pressure from within. His outlook is uncertain.</p>
<p>Richard D. Birch, nightwatchman for the Merchant&#8217;s Fire Dispatch, has given conflicting statements regarding the shooting, and will surely face manslaughter charges should his victim perish.</p>
