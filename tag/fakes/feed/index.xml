<p>&quot;Wanna make some easy money? Come over here. Hang on a sec, let me just fix my coat, and now&#8230; here we go, will ya look at that! Looks like my wrist&#8217;s broken, eh? Naw, I just popped it out of the joint. It&#8217;s easy if you know how, especially if it&#8217;s been broken as many times as mine has. Now about that money. See, I&#8217;ll get a ride in your taxi, and while we&#8217;re riding, I&#8217;ll yell and come up with the broken wrist. Your boss&#8217;ll pay me to go away! You do the talking, and I&#8217;ll do the yelling. I can make my face look green, too, if I concentrate. And what we make, I&#8217;ll split with you. I&#8217;ll take nothing less than $2500. It can&#8217;t lose!&quot;</p>
<p>Alas, poor Calaway Rice and his gal Ruth Richardson, they thought Yellow Cab driver Paul C. Alexander had a dishonest face, but they were very wrong. Alexander took the scheme straight from Rice&#8217;s downtown hotel room to his boss, who told him to go through with the charade. It went on under the scrutiny of a police escort, who broke in on the Main Street doctor&#8217;s splinting party to put ol&#8217; Popped Joints Rice and Miss Richardson in irons. </p>
<p>The charge was conspiracy to commit fraud. And while Rice would be convicted of this crime, the lady was acquitted, which gave Rice&#8217;s attorney the opportunity to appeal to the judge&mdash;how could a man conspire alone? It was a good point, and on May 9, our loose-limbed hero was turned loose to scam again.</p>
