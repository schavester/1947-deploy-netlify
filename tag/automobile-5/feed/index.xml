<p>Kim&rsquo;s <a href="https://1947project.com/?p=2159" target="_blank" title="bundy">post </a>a few days ago about the ineffectual hammer attack led me to this tale, which ends in what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamer " target="_blank" title="gamers">those</a> of the gaming community refer to as a &ldquo;finishing move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph J. Zazala, 37, was sweet on Grace Hardesty, 35.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d been seeing her for a spell.&nbsp; They took a little ride three miles north of Berdoo.&nbsp; Perhaps he hummed a little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_My_Merry_Oldsmobile" target="_blank" title="merry">tune</a>.&nbsp; He parked.&nbsp; Maybe he&rsquo;d sneak a little smooch!&nbsp; Oh, and he brought along some <em>things</em>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The blood-and-gore stained hammer disclosed that Grace had fought, in the car, long and hard for her life, and eventually escaped.&nbsp; She was on her knees at the roadside, apparently pleading for mercy, when he put his other tool, the shotgun, in her mouth and pulled the trigger.&nbsp; He then turned the weapon on himself.</p>
<p>Sheriff Shay found letters in Grace&rsquo;s pocket indicating that while she and Ralph had been acquainted for some time, she was in fact a <em>Mrs</em>. Grace Hardesty, a fact to which Ralph evidently objected. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And so ended more love-stained, blood-stained Southern California romantic bliss.</p>

<p>June 25, 1927<br />Los Angeles</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="197" height="240" border="0" align="right" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1088/623181919_c0e174615e_m.jpg" alt="Johnston car" title="Johnston car" /></p>
<p>Mr. H. Johnston has just completed a nine day journey along the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Old_Trails_Highway" title="Old Trails Hwy">National Old Trails Highway</a> from Los Angeles to Philadelphia. Amazingly, he made the cross-country trip in his $10 dollar 1919 Ford! His total expenses, including gasoline, meals, lodging, and one minor $3 repair to the Ford was a miserly $55 ($657.31 USD 2007). </p>
<p>Impressive? Absolutely! But, future dwellers, while we shake our heads in wonderment at how inexpensive it was to live in 1927 America, let&rsquo;s put on our time travel goggles and look at this feat&nbsp;from a different perspective.</p>
<p>If Mr. H. Johnston went out today and purchased an entry level 2007 Toyota&nbsp;Prius ($22,175.00)&nbsp;it would cost him $265,015.46 in 1927 dollars. Gasoline for the hybrid would take a bite out of his budget to the tune of about $35.83 per gallon! </p>
<p>Nine nights at a Motel 6 (at $69.99 per night) would set Mr. Johnston back a whopping $7,528.14. And that&rsquo;s if he didn&rsquo;t rent any movies. At these prices he may lose his appetite, but a man has to eat. Let&rsquo;s give Mr. Johnston a total food budget of $45 to visit a drive-thru of his choice once each day &ndash; that translates into $537.80 in current dollars for burgers, fries and sodas. </p>
<p>Get out your calculators and we&rsquo;ll do a back-of-the-envelope&nbsp;estimate for Mr. Johnston&rsquo;s trek in the strange 2007 time machine. The nine day vacation would now cost him approximately $275,052.25. </p>
<p>Your mileage may vary. </p>

<p>One Thomas Little was attempting to <a title="avoraid!" target="_blank" href="https://1947project.com/?p=1940">raid</a> the fabled <a href="http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt0b69p2j1/?layout=metadata&#038;brand=oac" target="_blank" title="utt">Utt</a> <a title="avocado" target="_blank" href="http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:bV6vP9BardEJ:www.avocadosource.com/CAS_Yearbooks/CAS_16_1931/CAS_1931_PG_207-210.pdf+%22lemon+heights%22+utt+avocado&#038;hl=en&#038;ct=clnk&#038;cd=1&#038;gl=us&#038;client=firefox-a">avocado</a> groves down in <a title="lemonheights" target="_blank" href="http://www.latimes.com/classified/realestate/printedition/la-re-guide29may29,0,3788850.story?coll=la-class-realestate">Lemon Heights</a> when he ran afoul of &lsquo;cado guard George Henning.&nbsp; The two struggled for possession of a revolver while the two careened down a hillside in Litttle&#8217;s truck before Little was at last apprehended.</p>
<p>But, with Little having stolen nothing, how could it be proved that the value of what he intended to steal was more than $200?&nbsp; It was therefore up to Justice Morrison to determine the value of the accused man&rsquo;s intended grand larcency haul.&nbsp; Dep. Dist.-Atty. Collins produced the fifteen empty sacks that Mr. Little had in tow; the court estimated these sacks would likely hold fifteen hundred pounds of the bewitching fruit, and further determined that these be worth more than the lowest grand larceny charge of $200.</p>
<p>All that notwithstanding, it was declared at the hearing that Little came quite close to being caught in a bear trap.</p>
