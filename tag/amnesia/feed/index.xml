<p>Between Christ&rsquo;s wanderings in the deserts of Jericho, and Kidder&rsquo;s huddlings in the gardens of Glendale, there was Robert Sankey. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Sankey, 44, a prominent Riverside contractor, was in a splendid mood September seventh last; he had no domestic or financial troubles, and bid his lovely wife and 13 year-old daughter goodbye that morning in his home at <a title="houseofsankey" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=270+Bandini+Avenue,+Riverside,+California&#038;sll=33.969986,-117.392092&#038;sspn=0.016016,0.029182&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=33.972122,-117.392092&#038;spn=0.032031,0.058365&#038;z=14&#038;iwloc=cent&#038;om=1">270 Bandini Avenue</a> before a trip to Laguna Beach.&nbsp; He made it to Laguna Beach, and picked up $12,000 ($132,359 USD2006) in cash which he had been paid by the Colton School Board for the construction of Colton High School.</p>
<p>Sankey then told friends he was going for a swim, and left his bag, clothing, glasses and&nbsp; shoes at a hotel near the beach.&nbsp; From there he disappeared&hellip;the sea was dragged repeatedly for his body, but to no avail.&nbsp; Had the briny deep swallowed Sankey?&nbsp; And what became of the <em>money</em>?&nbsp; And what&rsquo;s this?&mdash;a few days ago, some Sankey acquaintance came forth and reported having seen Sankey on a Seattle-bound boat a day or two after the disappearance.</p>
<p>Today, Mrs. Paul McKenzie peered nervously through the window of her home at <a title="sankeyssis" target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=4010+E+Massachusetts+St,+Long+Beach,+Los+Angeles,+California+90814,+United+States&#038;sll=33.972122,-117.392092&#038;sspn=0.032031,0.058365&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;cd=1&#038;geocode=0,33.768953,-118.145514&#038;ll=33.76973,-118.145514&#038;spn=0.008027,0.014591&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1">4010 Massachusetts, Long Beach</a>.&nbsp; There was a dazed, raggedy man wandering aimlessly up and down in front of her house for the better part of two hours.&nbsp; When she got up the nerve to confront the torn and tattered stranger, all a-jibber-jabberin&#8217; to himself, it was, you guessed it, her brother, Robert Sankey.&nbsp; Oh no, he insisted, <em>I&rsquo;m Andrew Borg</em>.</p>
<p>Well, the Borg, I mean Sankey, had only $500 left (in checks issued by a Seattle bank) of the twelve grand, and even less of an idea as to where he&rsquo;d been or what he&rsquo;d done.&nbsp; He could only confirm that his clothes had been given to him by &ldquo;the skipper,&rdquo; and that he&rsquo;d been to sea in a small boat with two men and a woman.</p>
<p>Further investigation revealed that Sankey recently boarded the steamer <a title="theevanger" target="_blank" href="https://content.lib.washington.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/imlsmaritime&#038;CISOPTR=324&#038;REC=6">Evanger</a> at San Francisco (booking passage to Buenos Aires as &ldquo;Andrew Borg, grain dealer, Witchita, Kan.&rdquo;), but put ashore at San Pedro the day he reappeared in Long Beach.</p>
<p>Sankey remains in his Borgian state at Seaside hospital, where Riverside county authorities are vexed with Seaside staff; the Sheriff is itching to serve two warrants on Sankey, each charging sixteen counts of violating the State wage law, but the pesky physicians demand that officers wait &lsquo;til Sankey&rsquo;s physical condition permits such activity.</p>
<p>Whether amnesia or grift, please bear in mind&hellip;steer clear of small boats, and beware &quot;the skipper.&quot;</p>
