<p>Gentle reader, </p>
<p>Although we selfishly wish you to stay here all day, frittering, may we nonetheless suggest a pair of historically-minded websites you might explore?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.backroadsofamericanmusic.com/" target="_blank">Backroads of American Music</a> operates from the charming supposition that&nbsp; the places where great music was made and heard, or where music makers broke bread, prayed or knocked their wives around, are worth visiting, photographing and talking about. Obviously, we quite <a href="http://www.esotouric.com/rock" target="_blank">agree</a>. The site is interactive, and welcomes your contributions and comments. </p>
<p><a href="http://bigorangelandmarks.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Big Orange Landmarks</a>, penned by the hirsute Floyd B. Bariscale, is one of those stunt blogs that the kids are all talking about. Only instead of cooking his way through the <em>Larousse Gastronomique</em> or eating nothing but peanut brittle and tracking the results, Floyd is working his way chronologically through the historic-cultural monuments of our great city, documenting the histories, providing new photographs, crowing when delighted and quite frankly stating his disappointment when the journey proves more than the destination. He&#8217;s up to #75, over on Carroll Avenue in Angelino Heights, but we&#8217;ll have to wait a while until he reaches&nbsp; <a href="http://www.you-are-here.com/victorian/grocery.html" target="_blank">Bob&#8217;s Market</a>, just steps away, but numbered 215. </p>
