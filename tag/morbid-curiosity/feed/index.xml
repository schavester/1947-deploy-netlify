</span><span style="font-size:100%;">Los Angeles</span><br />
<span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;">Olga Miller was a comely young thing who worked at the Hotel Rosslyn and was considered quite attractive despite the scar on he</span><span style="font-size:100%;">r temple from shooting herself in the head.<br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size:100%;">One day she fell ill and was taken to County Hospital, where she went into convulsions and died after a visit from Richard Hardy, who forced his way into her room and made her drink a glass of milk that police suspected was poisoned.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size:100%;">But her death was only the beginning of the complicated story, a morbidly Victorian tale that includes murder, insanity, false identities, suicides and fears of body snatching.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size:100%;">Shortly after Miller died, officials learned that she was actually Bertha Beilstein, the daughter of John Frederick Beilstein, a wealthy Allegheny, Pa., businessman  and politician. Before his mysterious death in 1897 (some people suspected Bertha of poisoning him in a fit of insanity), he wrote a will putting all his money in a trust for his heirs as long as she was alive.</p>
