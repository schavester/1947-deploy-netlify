Hollywood</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a father to do?&rdquo; lamented Dr. Eric R. Wilson today, after his 17-year-old daughter, Dorothy, accused him of beating her and taking her money before throwing her out of the house. Police officers escorted the girl to Juvenile Hall after they discovered her, hysterical, outside the family home at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=N+Mansfield+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+California&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=29.634084,57.832031&#038;hl=en&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.090767,-118.340607&#038;spn=0.030209,0.056477&#038;z=14&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="Location of the Wilson home.">176 North Mansfield Avenue</a>, Hollywood. Their first stop, however, was at Receiving Hospital, where Dorothy was treated for a broken nose, injuries to her eyes, and bruises to her lips and body.   </p>
<p>Wilson admitted he &ldquo;slapped&rdquo; Dorothy after he and his wife returned from the theater last night and observed shadowy figures slipping out the side entrance as they entered the front door. Dorothy denied she had gentlemen callers while her parents were out. &ldquo;She lied to me, and I make no apology for it,&rdquo; said Wilson. &ldquo;I slapped her down. She hit the side of the davenport and rolled on the floor, and then she pulled the hysterical stuff.&rdquo; He denied taking Dorothy&rsquo;s money or ordering her to leave home. </p>
<p>According to her father, among other wild pranks, Dorothy broke into garages and took cars without their owners&rsquo; permission (some might call this grand theft auto, but not Dr. Wilson). &ldquo;I tried everything to make her happy,&rdquo; the put-upon father continued, &ldquo;I gave her an allowance of $50 a month and promised her a roadster if she would pass in her studies, but it did no good. She is incorrigible; she was put out of Hollywood High School; I tried to place her in the Ramona convent and they wouldn&rsquo;t take her.&rdquo;   </p>
<p>Officials at Juvenile Hall confirmed that Dorothy Wilson was incommunicado pending an interview with a policewoman.   </p></div>
