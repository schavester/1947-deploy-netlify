<p>June 5, 1927<br />Hollywood</p>
<p>The headlines turned her story into a clich&eacute;:  a young woman from the Midwest commits suicide by swallowing poison after the Hollywood star machine chews her up and spits her out. But 22-year-old Patricia Marshall&rsquo;s death today was a bit more complicated than that.   </p>
<p>For one thing, though she took part in amateur dramatics back home in Missouri and worked as a film extra since her arrival in Hollywood three years ago, Patricia aspired to a career in business. Until recently she had been a student at the Hollywood Secretarial College.   </p>
<p>Then there were the letters in her room. In one, written about a week before she died but never sent, the young woman made a declaration she was ultimately unable to keep:  &ldquo;There are so many suicides in Hollywood one must wear armor and make a vow against self-extinction&mdash;in suicide by poison.&rdquo; In addition to this and a note addressed to her mother (&ldquo;You are to forget me. Never think of me.&rdquo;), there were several missives to and from various men. When police contacted one of them, insurance man Harry Rosenberg of Washington, D.C., he called himself an &ldquo;old friend&rdquo; of the deceased but insisted there was never a hint of romance between them.   </p>
<p>This assertion was refuted by Patricia Marshall&rsquo;s mother, who testified at a coroner&rsquo;s inquest that her daughter and Rosenberg were engaged and planned to be married soon. Imagine Mrs. Marshall&rsquo;s shock when it came out that Patricia&rsquo;s &ldquo;fianc&eacute;&rdquo; was already married and the father of several children. Nor was that all&mdash;there were those damnable letters. In one, Rosenberg cut off his $15 weekly payments to Patricia; in another, his daughter threatened to have her arrested for blackmail and extortion if Patricia continued to annoy her father for money.   </p>
<p>Perhaps with Mrs. Marshall in mind, the coroner discreetly concluded that Patricia committed suicide after a &ldquo;disappointment&rdquo; in love.</p>
