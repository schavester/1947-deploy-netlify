<p>October 28, 1927<br />Los Angeles</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="249" height="190" border="0" align="right" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2245/1781129884_4df6676a55_o.jpg" alt="hotmamma" title="hotmamma" />The vice bulls had a titillating time on <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=337+S+Main+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90013&#038;sll=34.04577,-118.24931&#038;sspn=0.001029,0.001692&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.048757,-118.246762&#038;spn=0.001029,0.001692&#038;t=k&#038;z=19&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="337southmain">Main Street</a> tonight as they swooped down on the scantily-clad hot mammas of &ldquo;Hot Mamma&rdquo; at the <a href="http://cinematreasures.org/theater/2202/" target="_blank" title="folliestheatre">Follies Theater</a>, grabbing twenty-seven of the tiny-leaf&rsquo;d gals and loading them into paddy wagons.&nbsp; Also arrested were twelve chorus men of the Hot Mamma show; further pinched were four tattooed women in their work clothes, and of course Ili Ili, the untamed tree-climbing South African pygmy (this last group in violation of Ordinance 6859, aka barking a show on the sidewalk, outside the Dreamland Palace at <a title="539southmain" target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=539+S+Main+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90013&#038;sll=34.04969,-118.246386&#038;sspn=0.008232,0.01354&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.046148,-118.24909&#038;spn=0.002058,0.003385&#038;t=k&#038;z=18&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1">539 South Main</a>).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="108" border="0" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2363/1780348717_d7617f4d16_o.jpg" alt="dreamland" title="dreamland" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="235" height="143" border="0" align="left" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2349/1780348729_f74905b10f_o.jpg" alt="fightinpriests" title="fightinpriests" />What gives?&nbsp; Well, it&rsquo;s 1927, and saucy soubrettes kicking up their heels (oh you kid!) in the undesirable theaters of Street Main was too much for the dogooding Men of the Cloth, who remembered a time when there was no such flapping, before ladies in their runabouts had bathtub gin on the breath of a mouth slathered in kiss-proof lipstick and the men who love them, and so forth, and it was time to put a stop to it.&nbsp; On October 27, pioneering radio evangelists Dr. Gustav Briegleb and the Rev. Robert P. &ldquo;<a title="fightinbob" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_P._Shuler">Fighting Bob</a>&rdquo; Shuler took in the show at the Follies, and called in the coppers to shut it down tonight.&nbsp; On November 29, Shuler and Briegleb were called to the stand to testify as to the show&rsquo;s indecency.&nbsp; Follies showgirls put on a good show at the Hall of Justice, too, as they loudly hissed the ministers.&nbsp; (Of course they hissed!&nbsp; Are they not <a title="serpents!" target="_blank" href="http://witcombe.sbc.edu/eve-women/5eveserpent.html">serpents</a> leading men astray as She did at the Fall of Man?!)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="238" height="211" border="0" align="right" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2152/1780348699_5f5c3edf7a_o.jpg" alt="blushing" title="blushing" />It&rsquo;s a good thing counsel made a point of selecting an all-male jury, as the vivid descriptions of indecent dances, songs, jokes and costumes brought blushes to the faces of jurors, court spectators and court attaches during the trial.&nbsp; The highlight of the trial was Rev. Shuler himself, who read from his copious, filthy notes, which recounted a lewd performance between two girls playing the parts of deserted wives looking for their husbands in the barroom of a ship.&nbsp; And Shuler&rsquo;s dead-on imitation of a &ldquo;licentious smile&rdquo; which he asserted to be part of the dancers&rsquo; repertoire brought such an outburst from the crowd of spectators (and the Hot Mamma girls) that the bailiff threatened to clear the courtroom.</p>
<p>Preacher Briegleb minced no words:&nbsp; &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t have enough clothes on to flag a handcar,&rdquo; said he, and described the activities of the chorus as &ldquo;a moving sea of contortions of all that was low and vile.&rdquo;&nbsp; Defense counsel asked that the good minister confine himself to the facts, but what fun is that?&nbsp; In the dancers&rsquo; defense, Dorothy Walton, the blonde &ldquo;Cleopatra&rdquo; of the play, described her dancing as being &ldquo;combinations of modern and classical steps&rdquo; in which, she admitted, did in fact move every part of her body. &nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="485" height="67" border="0" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2063/1780348767_862783ffed_o.jpg" alt="follies27ad" title="follies27ad" /></p>
<p>Which seemed hunky-dory with the aforementioned all-male jury, who set the lot free, save for four defendants&mdash;Tom B. Dalton, Robert Whalen, Harry Graves and Charles B. Dameron&mdash;found guilty based on their admitted connection with the management of the show and their writing of the dialogue.&nbsp; These Hot Papas were sentenced by Municipal Judge Frederickson to serve 150 days in the City Jail in addition to $500 ($5,515 USD2006) fines each:&nbsp; &ldquo;It is my clearly defined duty to impose the severest sentence possible upon these defendants in order that such performances will not continue in this city&hellip;certainly the dances staged with their help were not artistic as claimed by them.&nbsp; The defendants have had a fair and unbiased trial and convicted of a most serious offense to society.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="235" height="239" border="0" align="left" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2340/1780348777_e56dfc31f2_o.jpg" alt="folliesad1939" title="folliesad1939" />Needless to say, the Follies soldiered on.&nbsp; It was remodeled by <a title="scharleslee" target="_blank" href="http://digital.library.ucla.edu/sclee/">S. Charles Lee</a> in the 1930s, and thereafter saw many decades of shimmy-shammyin&rsquo; by <a title="lili" target="_blank" href="http://www.vivavavoom.com/girls/lili/photo.html">Lili St. Cyr</a>, <a title="anncorio" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Corio">Ann Corio</a> and <a title="bettyrowland" target="_blank" href="http://www.archive.org/details/stripper_betty_rowland">Betty &ldquo;Ball of Fire&rdquo; Rowland</a>.&nbsp; Eventually girlesque went the way of vaudeville, and the Follies became a skin-flick house.&nbsp; In 1968 <a title="eleanorgeeIthinkyou'reswell" target="_blank" href="http://www.publicartinla.com/CivicCenter/chambers1.html">Eleanor Chambers</a>, executive assistant to Mayor Yorty, led the fight to have the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Board add the Follies to its list of culturally significant buildings (who had just added a <a title="graumanshcm" target="_blank" href="http://bigorangelandmarks.blogspot.com/2007/08/no-55-graumans-chinese-theatre.html">theater</a> <em>and</em> something <a title="bullockshcm" target="_blank" href="http://bigorangelandmarks.blogspot.com/2007/08/no-56-bullocks-wilshire-building.html">art deco</a>).&nbsp; The board nixed that idea as beneath them (rejecting the <a title="burbanktheatre" target="_blank" href="http://cinematreasures.org/theater/1988/">Burbank</a>/<a title="burlesk" target="_blank" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_muE6ZaFcw_M/RjdmFhymdCI/AAAAAAAAABs/08kyz_MCvy4/s1600-h/burbank.jpg">Burlesk</a> at <a title="548southmain" target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=548+S+Main+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90013&#038;sll=34.046632,-118.249197&#038;sspn=0.008232,0.01354&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.04577,-118.24931&#038;spn=0.001029,0.001692&#038;t=k&#038;z=19&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1">548 South Main</a> as well).&nbsp;</p>

<p>And then, in May of 1974&mdash;the month that the House of Representatives opened its impeachment hearings against President Nixon, the Follies was razed, and now, in its place, stands the Ronald Reagan building:</p>
