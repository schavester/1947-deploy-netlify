<div align="left">18-year-old Ora Obetz appeared in court today seeking to have her marriage of 5 years annulled.&nbsp; It seems that prior to their marriage, her husband, Louis Allen Obetz, 47, had been her stepfather.</p>
<p>When Ora&#8217;s mother died in 1920, the girl was left in the custody of Obetz, who spent the next few years traveling around the Ozarks in a wagon with her.&nbsp; When she turned 13, he gave her the choice of being placed in juvenile home, a convent, or becoming his wife.&nbsp; After a month of convent living, Ora finally consented to marry him in Kansas.</p>
<p>A year later, Ora gave birth to a son, and the Obetzs moved to Los Angeles.&nbsp; Shortly thereafter, Louis threatened Ora at gunpoint, at which point, the brave girl picked up her infant son, marched out the door, and left Obetz for good.&nbsp; That was two years ago.</p>
<p>Since then, Obetz filed a $100,000 &quot;alienation of affection&quot; suit against 83-year-old A.F. Christianson, a wealthy Angeleno whom Obetz claimed had influenced Ora&#8217;s decision to leave him.&nbsp; But before that case was heard, Ora had her day in Superior Court.&nbsp; The issue at hand was not whether Ora was coerced into marriage, due to the fact that Kansas had no laws mandating the age at which girls could marry.&nbsp; However, the legality of the marriage was called into question by Ora&#8217;s testimony that a friend of Obetz&#8217;s had posed as her dead father in order to obtain the marriage license.</p>
<p>On December 7, 1927, Obetz&#8217;s suit against Christianson was dismissed when the former failed to appear in court.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t show his face on the 9th either, when Ora Obetz was granted her annulment and full custody of her son. </div>
