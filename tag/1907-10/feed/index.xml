<div><strong>Reminder, you have until February 5 to submit your proposals for the 1907 Centennial celebration. We&#8217;ve already received some fascinating submissions&#8211;including one for the first public appearance in more than a decade of a legendary L.A. postpunk band, presenting a live score to a Melies Brothers short &#8212; and would love to have you be a part of it. So send over your ideas, half-baked or cooked straight through, and join us on March 22 at Bedlam.</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>1907 Centennial &#8211; open call for performers</strong></p>
<p>For the past year, the bloggers at 1947project.com have been immersed in the weird old L.A. of 1907, a city of open sewers and Mexican revolutionaries, 15mph hot rodders and prankster firemen, holy rollers and hollow earthers. As the calendar strikes March and the conclusion of twelve months of 1907 research, we&#8217;re hosting a special centennial celebration, and we&#8217;d like YOU to be a part of it.</p>
<p>Writers, musicians, actors, artists, comics, storytellers, vaudevillians, curators, filmmakers, historians, poets and others are invited to propose a 3-10 minute presentation on a theme inspired by 1907-era Los Angeles (or the wider world). Your piece can be original or an adaptation of something you&#8217;ve read on 1947project.com or elsewhere. All media are welcome (we can provide amplification and video projection). The only requirements are that it be entertaining and respectful to any crime victims involved.</p>
<p>Prospective presenters should provide the following:<br />1) A one paragraph creative bio, 200 words or less, suitable for publication <br />2) A description of what you propose to do at the 1907 Centennial event, noting any source material that you have been inspired by<br />3) Length of proposed performance<br />4) Contact info <br />5) Your website or other helpful links</p>
<p>Event curators Kim Cooper, Larry Harnisch, Lucinda Michele Knapp and Nathan Marsak will be collecting proposals through February 5 and announcing the line up shortly afterwards. The &#8217;07 celebration will be held on Thursday, March 22 at Bedlam Art downtown, and will culminate in the festive revelation by a very special musical guest of which historic year will next get the archival treatment from 1947project. The event will be free, with refreshments and libations on hand. Vintage recipes will be provided for those who enjoy cooking to contribute pot luck offerings to share.</p>
<p>Need more info to stoke the fires of your creativity? Visit <a href="http://https://pensive-torvalds-020d34.netlify.app/?page_id=1832" target="_self">www.1947project.com/1907</a> for some helpful historic resources.</p>
<p>Please submit your proposal for The 1907 Centennial by February 5 to Kim by <a target="_self" href="http://www.47upgradepath7.richardschave.com//feedback">email</a> or mail to PO Box 31227, Los Angeles CA 90031.</p>

<p>April 15, 1907<br />
Pasadena</p>
<p>As criminality reaches epidemic proportions in sleepy Pasadena, the citizenry grumbles about Chief Pinkham&#8217;s skills as police head, and makes noises about replacing him.</p>
<p>The latest outrage was visited upon George Syer, a public carriage driver who was called out to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=876+lincoln+ave.,+pasadena,+CA&amp;ll=34.152727,-118.157487&amp;spn=0.014987,0.040383" target="_blank">876 Lincoln Avenue</a> this evening, ostensibly to take some women to a train. The address should have been found north of Mountain, in an unlit area. He did not find the house, but while looking was acosted by a man with a thick Irish brogue who demanded his money. Syer parted with a dollar in change, but kept the contents of his other pocket. No mention was made of a weapon being brandished, but it is well known that one can&#8217;t be too careful with Irishmen!</p>

<p>March 30, 1907<br /> Los Angeles&nbsp;</p>
<p>Newlyweds Mr. and Mrs. Paul Solf, a couple from Denver who have been honeymooning at the Estelle at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=312+W+1st+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90012&#038;ll=34.055255,-118.245807&#038;spn=0.013618,0.037122" target="_blank">312 1/2 West First Street</a>, paid a visit to the police this evening at the insistence of the lady.  </p>
<p>Paul Solf told the desk sergeant that he had returned to their room earlier, to find his wife reading a letter from a former admirer. As he snatched it away, a photograph fell out, and the pair commenced to arguing. After a time, Mrs. Solf said that if he did not accompany her to the police station, she would call for them herself. Thinking she was bluffing, he joined her in a perambulation towards Central Station.</p>
<p> Upon entering, Mrs. Solf declared that Paul Solf had threatened her with a revolver. He denied this, but a quick search revealed a heavy revolver on his person. Solf was locked up, while officers determined that he had a letter for $5000 credit from a Denver bank, and nearly as much in cash. On reflection, Mrs. Solf decided she didn&#8217;t wish to prosecute, but officers still plan to charge him for carrying a concealed weapon.</p>
<p>Solf is a race horse man, and his bride a bit of a gambler.&nbsp;</p>

<p>March 27, 1907<br /> Los Angeles&nbsp;</p>
<p>After visiting her Chinese husband in the County Jail, Mrs. Yee Lung (also called Mrs. Frank Chew) spoke of her intention to join her beloved as he was deported, and to travel with him in the train car packed with forty other Chinese deportees for the trip up to San Francisco. </p>
<p>Special permission has been granted by the U.S. Marshall for her to ride with her husband. They will immediately board a boat to Hong Kong, and the woman may never again see her white friends relatives in this country.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lung&#8217;s friends have pleaded with her to reconsider, but she insists &quot;I trust my husband implicitly&#8230; he wouldn&#8217;t go without me, and I wouldn&#8217;t be so cruel as to ask him to.&quot; </p>

<p>A special correspondent follows up on the distressing report of a cow gravely injured when struck by an electric car near <a href="http://www.wemweb.com/railroad-stations/ref30.html" target="_blank">Lamanda Park</a>. Bossy was found happily chewing her cud with no sign of injury. As near as can be figured, the trolley ran over the cow&#8217;s tether, pulling it taut and forcing the reluctant acrobat to turn a dramatic aerial flip. She seems to have landed safely and forgotten all about her wild adventure, until the cries of do-gooders to the Humane Society roused an interest in her case. </p>

<p>March 18, 1907<br /> Los Angeles&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="129" height="254" border="0" align="left" src="//static.flickr.com/34/114502149_fe1d8ee284_o.jpg" />Carlos Perez, an unarmed man shot by an <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=olvera+street,+Los+Angeles,+CA&#038;ll=34.058455,-118.237352&#038;spn=0.016284,0.04004" target="_blank">Olvera Street</a> nightwatchman as he walked towards his home on Macy Street last evening, lies tonight in County Hospital, gravely wounded with a bullet puncuring his lung. A gruesome side effect of his injury is that air is seeping beneath his skin, inflating his body like a fleshy balloon. Doctors can press gently on the man&#8217;s hands, eyelids and ribcage, causing him to briefly deflate, though he quickly swells up again.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Dr. Barber, the hospital superintendent, says that he has seen victims who suffer minor inflation around their injuries, but never someone whose entire body becomes so like a balloon. Doctors hesitate to puncture Perez&#8217; skin for fear of introducing an infection, and so the poor man suffers the strange sensation of constant pressure from within. His outlook is uncertain.</p>
<p>Richard D. Birch, nightwatchman for the Merchant&#8217;s Fire Dispatch, has given conflicting statements regarding the shooting, and will surely face manslaughter charges should his victim perish.</p>
