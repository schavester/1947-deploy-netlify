<p>June 12, 1927<br />Los Angeles  </p>
<p>Is there anything more quaint than a peanut wagon, its operator on life&rsquo;s downward slope yet cheerfully awaiting only a word from you to scoop up a paper sack of delicious, salty goobers? This was the face that 72-year-old Victor Tartas presented to the world&mdash;-until recently.   </p>
<p>To the untrained eye, the steady stream of customers at the peanut stand bore testimony only to the elderly Tartas&rsquo;s business acumen and pleasant personality. But Sergeant Adams of the Los Angeles Police Department detected something peculiar in the peanut vendor&rsquo;s manner:  if an approaching customer whistled once, Tartas responded with a single blast of the peanut cart&rsquo;s horn. Two whistles were met with two toots on the horn. A quick investigation revealed several pints of whiskey nestled beneath a false bottom in the wagon.   </p>
<p>Despite evidence to the contrary (twenty gallons of moonshine, a small still and a &ldquo;quantity&rdquo; of mash were found at the peanut vendor&rsquo;s home at <a title="The peanut vendor's home." target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=2118+brooklyn+avenue,+los+angeles,+california&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=57.162571,97.03125&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.043948,-118.19139&#038;spn=0.014793,0.023689&#038;z=15&#038;iwloc=cent&#038;om=1">2118-1/2 Brooklyn Avenue)</a>, Tartas pleaded not guilty. Jury trial was set for September 13, 1927. Bail was fixed at $1,000&#8211;which, it must be stated, wasn&rsquo;t peanuts.    </p>
