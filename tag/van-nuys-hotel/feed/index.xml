<p>During tonight&rsquo;s dinnertime&mdash;the fashionable hour for society at the Hotel Van Nuys at Fourth and Main (Morgan &amp; Walls, 1896) a furry friend decided to hobnob with the upper crust.&nbsp; Strolling in through the Fourth Street entrance like the most gracious of chaps, of which there were many in the lobby, came a great husky sewer rat. &nbsp;<img loading="lazy" width="415" height="279" border="0" align="right" title="vannuys" alt="vannuys" src="//static.flickr.com/98/259928223_ad0f6b3a33_o.jpg" /></p>
<p>Pandemonium ensued:&nbsp; &ldquo;Dainty Parisian lingerie and open-work stockings appeared on view.&nbsp; Gallant gentlemen dropped their cigars and ladies jumped on chairs, but still the rat stood his ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Porters and elevator boys descended, and Mr. Rattus fled the scene through a hole in some missing wainscoting (the Van Nuys undergoing some changes to the lobby).&nbsp; Immediately the house ferret, kept in the engine room for just this sort of affair, was thrust into the opening. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A loud, chilling three-round bout ensued inside the wall, and the ferret emerged bloody and beaten.&nbsp; The rat stuck his nose out his hiding place as if to challenge all comers, and another ferret, this one less soft and over-weight, was sent in to dispatch the venturesome intruder.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The story headline says the rat was killed, but the actual tale makes no such mention.&nbsp; Without a body, I&rsquo;d say Mr. Ferret merely bragged about besting his opponent, and Mr. Rat went off to the Rosslyn, or perhaps the King Edward.</p>
<p>(The Van Nuys became the Hotel Barclay in the 1930s [adding a magnificent art deco neon blade sign]. The Barclay is now one of the many &ldquo;28-day-shuffle&rdquo; transient hotels in the area, where monthly rent is $360.)</p>
