Los Angeles</p>
<p>Police are searching for &#8220;bandit queen&#8221; Rose Berk with renewed effort after today&#8217;s arrest of one of her henchmen, Fred J. Cook. Berk (aka Rose Buckingham, aka Rose Burke) is suspected of masterminding more than half a dozen &#8220;feminine lure&#8221; robberies during the last week alone. During the course of these hold-ups, Berk pretended to be a helpless female seeking &#8220;assistance in starting a stalled automobile.&#8221; She was perhaps particularly suited to this role because, &#8220;unlike the usual type&#8221; of bandit queen, Berk was described by police as &#8220;homely, awkward in her manner and so old-fashioned that she still wears her hair long.&#8221; </p>
<p>However out of style she may have been, Berk evaded capture by the L.A.P.D. On April 13, 1927, she was behind the wheel of the getaway car when a group of hold-up men, Fred Cook among them, robbed the Seaboard National Bank on Wilshire Boulevard of $21,000. The hapless Cook was arrested two years later, when in August 1929, he was recognized on a visit to Rose Berk, then jailed in Indianapolis. Alas, her trail goes cold hereÃ¢â‚¬â€we&#8217;ll never know if she finally bobbed her hair. </p>
<p><i>Modeling the &#8220;old-fashioned&#8221; look is one of the winners of the</i> Times&#8217;s <i>Mary Pickford look-alike contest in 1924.</i></div>
