<p>Nick Santangelo saw my <a href="/?p=1546" target="_self">post</a> about the historic cobblestones exposed when Lincoln Heights was getting its roads repaved, and wanted to <a href="https://themistaken.com/UncoveredL.A..htm" target="_blank">share photos</a> of some of the brick streets and gutters in Highland Park and near Union Station. Some of these have already been covered over by insensitive city workers.</p>
<p><em>Nick says: The brick gutters on Avenues 41 and 45 (on North Figueroa) reminded me of Kim&#8217;s post. I have tried to get public works to stop paving over them as they are unique and historic but have not had any luck. I even sent some pics to the Highland Park Historical people but I never got a response. The new Homeboy Industries building near Phillipes sits next to a cobblestone street (Bruno, I think).<br /></em> </p>
<p>Sure, on a well travelled street it&#8217;s probably unreasonable to ask that archaic building materials bear the brunt of multi-ton SUVs&#8230; but can&#8217;t we somehow save the brick gutters in places where they&#8217;re still holding up so nicely?</p>
