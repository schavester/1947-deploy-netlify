<p>April 15, 1927 </p>
<p>L<img loading="lazy" width="240" height="118" border="0" align="left" title="menu" alt="menu" src="//farm1.static.flickr.com/173/459218082_4269a2e951_m.jpg" />adies of Los Angeles!&nbsp; Do your cakes fall?&nbsp; Is your husband weary of tough pot roast?&nbsp; Do the words, &quot;Company&#8217;s coming&quot; fill you with dread?&nbsp; Never fear, because Mabelle E. Wyman is here!</p>
<p>Throughout the 1920s, master chef A.L. Wyman answered the questions near and dear to the hearts of <em>Times</em> readers in his weekly column, &quot;Practical Recipes:&nbsp; Helps for Epicures and All Who Appreciate Good Cooking,&quot; supplemented by the popular daily feature, &quot;Suggestions for Tomorrow&#8217;s Menu.&quot;&nbsp; After Wyman&#8217;s death in 1926, his widow, Mabelle, immediately took over the columns.&nbsp; Then, she did him one better, announcing free cooking classes to be offered weekly under the auspices of the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>. <img loading="lazy" width="99" height="240" border="0" align="right" title="mabelle" alt="mabelle" src="//farm1.static.flickr.com/228/459218094_deb27e604e_m.jpg" /></p>
<p>Approximately 1000 Angelenos crowded into Wyman&#8217;s lecture room at the Southern California Manufacturers&#8217; Exhibit at <a title="Southern California Manufacturers Exhibit" target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=130+S+Broadway,+Los+Angeles,+California+90012&#038;sll=34.159634,-118.258038&#038;sspn=0.008789,0.014591&#038;layer=&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=16&#038;ll=34.054011,-118.245914&#038;spn=0.0088,0.014591&#038;om=1&#038;iwloc=addr">130 S. Broadway</a> for the inaugural class on April 15, some of them sitting on window sills and even under the enamel sink on the stage.&nbsp; Within a week, the <em>Times</em> announced that classes would be offered on Tuesdays and Fridays to accommodate the demand. </p>
<p>Domestic science was a relatively young discipline, and like many burgeoning fields, sought legitimacy in its early days by emphasizing the &#8216;science.&#8217;&nbsp; Nutrition, economy, efficiency, and tidy presentation were prized, sometimes over taste.&nbsp; While this era in culinary history gave us the icebox cake, it also ushered is a parade of congealed horrors like the tomato frappe (the less said of this unholy mixture of condensed soup and iceberg lettuce the better). </p>
<p>Wyman&#8217;s culinary focus was typical for the time, if quirkier.&nbsp; She emphasized meatless dishes, like her Potato and Peanut Sausages, as well as foods grown or produced in Southern California.&nbsp; Popular demonstrations included recipes for Spanish omelettes, cucumber loaf, orange cookies, and the ubiquitous tamale pie. </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="245" height="323" border="0" align="left" title="tamalepie" alt="tamalepie" src="//farm1.static.flickr.com/231/459218088_d45b72ab4e.jpg" />After the first class, Wyman encouraged her audience to submit questions to a question box, and guaranteed answers either during the next class or in her &quot;Practical Recipes&quot; column.&nbsp; While most columns simply answered requests for particular recipes, others were more cryptic.&nbsp; One can only wonder at the query that prompted Wyman to write, &quot;Mrs. S., Los Angeles:&nbsp; I am sorry but the law prohibits my either printing the recipe you ask for or sending it through the mail.&quot;&nbsp; Bathtub julep, anyone? </p>
<p>Wyman seems to have been as good as her word, frequently humoring readers who requested recipe reprints.&nbsp; Despite being demonstrated several times at her lectures, and appearing in A.L. Wyman&#8217;s posthumous <em>Daily Health Menus</em> (available for check out at the <a title="LAPL" target="_blank" href="http://www.lapl.org/">Los Angeles Public Library</a>), Mabelle printed the recipe for tamale pie no less than 10 times during her tenure with the <em>Times</em>. </p>
<p>The classes remained popular until Wyman&#8217;s sudden death on January 23, 1931.&nbsp; She was found at her home at <a title="Wyman home" target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=424+arden+ave.,+glendale,+ca&#038;sll=34.054011,-118.245914&#038;sspn=0.0088,0.014591&#038;layer=&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=16&#038;ll=34.159208,-118.262072&#038;spn=0.008789,0.014591&#038;om=1&#038;iwloc=addr">424 Arden Ave.</a> in Glendale (also the mailing address listed in her column for A.L. Wyman Laboratory Kitchen), having suffered a heart attack.&nbsp; Her estate, including a collection of over 200 cookbooks, was auctioned February 8, 1931. </p>
<p>Recommended reading:&nbsp; Laura Shapiro&#8217;s <em><a title="perfectionsalad" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Perfection-Salad-Cooking-Century-Library/dp/0375756655/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-9429639-4768169?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1176624729&#038;sr=8-1">Perfection Salad</a></em>, a lively study of domestic science and city cooking schools around the turn of the century, and Sylvia Lovegren&#8217;s <a title="fashionablefood" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Fashionable-Food-Seven-Decades-Fads/dp/0226494071/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-9429639-4768169?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1176624817&#038;sr=1-1"><em>Fashionable Food:&nbsp; Seven Decades of Food Fads</em></a>, a collection of trendy, eyebrow-raising recipes (including one for the ubiquitous tamale pie). </p>
<p>Also of interest:&nbsp; The <a title="foodtimeline" target="_blank" href="http://www.foodtimeline.org/">Food Timeline</a>, a culinary history project created and maintained by a librarian (woot!), featuring landmark foods trends through the ages.&nbsp; Peking duck to hummingbird cake, it&#8217;s all here. </p>
