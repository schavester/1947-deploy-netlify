										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="body">
<div>
<div align="left">August 22, 1927<br /> Van Nuys</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="240" height="108" border="0" align="left" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1109/1204188275_5c4fa34c4f_m.jpg" alt="orphan" title="orphan" /> One August night in 1927, Edgar Burnett of Van Nuys shot his wife, then turned the gun on himself, leaving their four children orphaned.&nbsp; The children were separated, and taken in by different families.&nbsp; Eleanor Ray Burnett, 7, was adopted by a wealthy Anaheim family; Ermie Jean, 3, was sent to Toronto to live with Miss Myrtle Hendrie; and Edgar Jr., 16 months, went to a Van Nuys family.</p>
<p> And today, the Burnett&#8217;s newborn daughter, Nona Lee, was adopted by Patrolman James Hayden of the Van Nuys police station and his wife.&nbsp; Nona was only 5 days old at the time of the killings, and the babe had been in her mother&#8217;s arms when Edgar Burnett fired the fatal shots.&nbsp; In 1927, it was reported that the Hayden&#8217;s would rear Nona &quot;never to know the tragedy of her early life,&quot; or about her brother and sisters.</p>
<p> However, at some point, the Hayden&#8217;s must have decided to tell Nona the truth about her past.&nbsp; And it seems a good thing they did.</p>
<p> You see, on Halloween night, 24 years later, 24-year-old Louis Shandra wrote a note, and went to his estranged wife&#8217;s apartment.&nbsp; The note read, &quot;I am going to kill my wife and myself tonight.&nbsp; I love her more than anything else in the world.&quot;</p>
<p> <img loading="lazy" width="229" height="187" border="0" align="right" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1381/1204188109_e0f2580f57_o.jpg" alt="guntragedy" title="guntragedy" />Shandra had recently served 30 days for beating his wife, Carmela, who had moved into her own place while Shandra was in jail.&nbsp; He went to the apartment at 808 E. Palmer Ave., Glendale, and shot Carmela to death with a rifle in front of the couple&#8217;s 2-year-old son, Bobby.&nbsp; Then, Shandra went into another apartment in the building, and killed himself.</p>
<p> A Ventura housewife married to Deputy Sheriff Warren Paul read about the tragedy in Glendale, and was so moved that she and her husband offered to adopt the child themselves.&nbsp; Nona Hayden Paul told the Los Angeles Times the circumstances of her early childhood and said, &quot;I wondered what would happen to that poor little boy.&nbsp; I talked to my husband about it and we&#8217;ve decided we&#8217;d love to raise him on our own.&quot;&nbsp; Warren Paul agreed readily &#8211; he, too, had been adopted as a child.</p></div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">No word on whether the adoption ultimately went through, or whether Mrs. Paul was ever reunited with her lost brother and sisters.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s hoping.&nbsp;</div>
