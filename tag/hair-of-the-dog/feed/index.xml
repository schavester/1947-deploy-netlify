<p>April 24, 1927<br />Los Angeles&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider if you will the American bootlegger, that rat among rats, profiteer and fiend, feeder of poison to nice kids who hardly deserve to go blind or mad, lose their teeth in a brawl or crack their skulls in a crash. In time, some will become respectable, send their sons to Harvard or even the White House, but not now. We all know what bootleggers are like&#8230; don&#8217;t we?</p>
<p>Maybe not. Consider Hattie Mitchell, address unprinted, who appeared in Municipal Judge Turney&#8217;s courtroom to face charges of dispensing fire water to quite an array of gentlemen. The twist? She served her liquor in her bedroom, while laid up with a broken leg. The whiskey bottles stayed under the covers getting warm when they weren&#8217;t being poured, and the government&#8217;s man never saw money change hands, but all the same&#8211;a speakeasy, right there in her sickroom, not to mention the impropriety of a half-clothed woman serving liquor to men who weren&#8217;t family!&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was all too much for Judge Turney to take, and so the (formerly?) supine lady was sentenced to six months in jail and a fine of $500. But here at 1947project, we salute a gal with the gumption to ensure a steady stream of visitors to her sickbed, and are already planning our own future recovery, which will include daily specials, jukebox music and popcorn shrimp served promptly at 4pm.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
