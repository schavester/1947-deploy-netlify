<p>August 4, 1927<img loading="lazy" width="287" height="121" border="0" align="right" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1244/1011281942_8f85a84c2e_o.gif" alt="ousterdamage" title="ousterdamage" /><br />San Pedro </p>
<p>That Ernest M. Branson just couldn&rsquo;t leave well enough alone.&nbsp; He was a member in good standing of <a href="http://www.iww.org/unions/iu510/sanpedro/ip1924.shtml" target="_blank" title="pedroklan">San Pedro</a> 51, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, and all was fine and hunky-dory, until he started stirring the pot with his <em>talk</em>.&nbsp; So from under the sheet came a big boot, and out went Ernest; now, Ernest says he was libeled in the written order that banished him from the Kluxers.</p>
<p>What was it ever did Ernest <em>say</em>?&nbsp; To hell with the flag?&nbsp; Hooray for Hebrews?&nbsp; Eucharist is yummy?&nbsp; Thomas Jefferson got it on with Sally Hemmings?</p>
<p>No, all he did was stir up some internal dissension inside the Klan, which resulted in his ouster (maybe he sided with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madge_Oberholtzer" target="_blank" title="oberholtzer">Madge over DC</a>.)&nbsp; That&rsquo;s gotta be the worst libel of all&mdash;accused of making mishegas in the klavern!</p>
<p>So now Ernest has filed a $25,000 ($275,749 USD2006) libel suit against none other than Exalted Cyclops Karl K. Keller. &nbsp;</p>
<p>(Yes, Karl K. Keller.&nbsp; I bet his real name was Herman Flork.)</p>
