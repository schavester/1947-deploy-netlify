<p>July 14, 1927<br />Los Angeles</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="247" height="122" border="0" title="taxi" alt="taxi" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1069/782968432_8c1ab04585_o.gif" /><br /><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="300" border="0" align="right" title="yellowcab" alt="yellowcab" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1169/782035755_1712cc764c_o.gif" />Clifford J. Morgan needed some dough&mdash;hey, don&rsquo;t we all&mdash;and what surer way to procure some than to stick up a gas station?&nbsp; So he hailed a dimbox and told the hack to take him off to the filling station at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=S+Figueroa+St+%26+W+Jefferson+Blvd,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90007&#038;sll=34.08618,-118.26608&#038;sspn=0.007482,0.014505&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.022982,-118.28001&#038;spn=0.007487,0.014505&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="jeffandfig">Jefferson and Figueroa</a>.&nbsp; There the would-be highwayman told the taxi to sit tight, strolled into the oilpit, stuck a gun in the ribs of one C. F. Williams, relieved him of $45 ($537 USD2005), sauntered back to his waiting hansom, and motored away.&nbsp; Unfortunately for Williams, do-gooders Ralph Paine and W. Burke were in the station at the time, and, grabbing Officer Best along the way, found Williams&rsquo; taxicab quite conspicuous in its lines and coloring and was thus followed easily.&nbsp; At <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?daddr=S+Central+Ave+%26+E+51st+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90011&#038;geocode=&#038;saddr=S+Figueroa+St+%26+W+Jefferson+Blvd,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90007&#038;f=d&#038;hl=en&#038;sll=33.998721,-118.256471&#038;sspn=0.007489,0.014505&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=14&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="thetrip">51st and Central</a> the trio caught up to and apprehended our hapless and callow highwayman.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="490" height="127" border="0" title="taxi2" alt="taxi2" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1148/782968448_c0f00c9640_o.gif" /><br /><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="196" border="0" align="left" title="taxibw" alt="taxibw" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1108/782035739_5976f9ec16_o.gif" />Vehicles-for-hire made the news <em>again</em> today in the strange case of five year-old Kenneth Stubbs, who had been placed by his mother Della in the home of Mrs. Bertha Whitiker at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;abauth=1b5ada3f%3ADG0H2Eg1fvR3BOt5dZzLF4bK9r8&#038;output=html&#038;sll=33.998721%2C-118.256471&#038;q=3040+S+Hoover+St%2C+Los+Angeles%2C+CA+90007%09&#038;btnG=Search+Maps#" target="_blank" title="shoover">3040 South Hoover</a>.&nbsp; Mrs. Whitiker reported that a man called at the house, purporting to represent a local orphanage in which the boy&rsquo;s mother wished to place him.&nbsp; After a brief conversation, the man departed.&nbsp; Two hours later, another man arrived in a taxicab.&nbsp; Mrs. Whitiker saw the little Stubbs boy invite the man into the apartment before witnessing said man scurry away with the boy in his arms, and the taxi speed away.&nbsp; (Estranged husband John Stubbs, up in Vancouver, is said not to know of Della&rsquo;s whereabouts and therefore could not be part of this misuse of our public transport.)&nbsp; No further mention of the Stubbs kidnapping, or of little Kenneth Stubbs, is ever made in the Times.</p>
