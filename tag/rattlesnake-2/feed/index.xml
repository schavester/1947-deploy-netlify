<p>April 17, 1927<br />Hollywood Boulevard</p>
<p>That&#8217;s actually Sue<em> Carol</em>, 5&#8217;3&quot;, Fox Films player and daughter of late &quot;Chicago capitalist&quot; Samuel M. Lederer (and later, the agent who discovered, married and buried Alan Ladd), modeling the reversible panne velvet-lined rattlesnakeskin coat her mama sent from home. 64 snakes, averaging more than four feet each, went into the garment, which some are calling Eve&#8217;s revenge. Miss Carol is currently appearing in <em>Slaves of Beauty</em>, a satire of the beauty parlor scene featuring some wacky business with a magical clay that leaves the skin under it lookin twenty years younger. Wonder if it works on rattlesnakes?</p>

<div>Newhall</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Mr. Lorenzo La Frank was working on his ranch in Newhall when attacked and bitten by a rattlesnake, which leaped and fastened itself upon his back, twisting itself around his suspenders.&nbsp; But La Frank&rsquo;s brave and faithful dog leapt as well, tearing the snake from his master.&nbsp; La Frank was admitted to County Hospital with a thinning of the blood, a condition peculiar and particular to a rattler&rsquo;s bite.&nbsp; Given as bethinned blood soaks through the walls of vessels, ending up in the lungs, La Frank is being administered copious whisky to combat the pneumonia he has subsequently contracted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; La Frank is expected to recover in full.</div>
