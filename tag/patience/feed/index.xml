<p>July 5, 1927<br />Venice&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was April 12, 1924, south of the border down Mehico way, when two brigands confronted Fedosis Alvarado on his ranch near Monte Escobeda, stole $2400 and shot him dead when he tried to defend his property. Arrested for the crime, Santiago Figueroa used the victim&#8217;s money to avoid prison time.</p>
<p>Fedosis&#8217; daughter, Maria Alvarado Gomez, was not satified with the verdict, and when she heard her father&#8217;s killer had moved to the beach at Los Angeles, she followed, taking a home at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=1508+Pennsylvania+Avenue,+Santa+Monica,+ca&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=63.215425,105.117188&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.032034,-118.469524&#038;spn=0.016467,0.025663&#038;z=15&#038;iwloc=cent&#038;om=1" target="_blank">1508 Pennsylvania Avenue, Santa Monica</a>. She haunted the public spaces along the shore, not in a spirit of seaside pleasure seeking, but in single-minded pursuit of the man whose face was burned into her brain.</p>
<p>Last night, as crowds packed the streets of Venice for Fourth of July revelry, she finally saw him and cried out to her friends, &quot;There he is, the murderer of my father, hold him, don&#8217;t let him get away!&quot;&nbsp; But in Spanish, because, you know, everyone involved spoke Spanish.</p>
<p>Traffic Officer Carter happened on the scene and took the players into custody, calling in auto camp manager Howard Wesson to translate. Once the story was explained, an envoy was dispatched to the Mexican Consulate, to determine if Figueroa was wanted in his homeland.</p>
<p>Obviously not, since there was no follow up story on the incident. Poor Maria. Should there be a next time, may we suggest she be prepared to exact her own swift justice on her prey, and not make the mistake of trusting law or nations to supply a daughter&#8217;s long overdue justice.</p>
