<div align="left">Today, women on the outskirts of town performed astounding acts of bravery, whether they were defending themselves, saving lives, or simply defying their mothers.</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">In Glendale, early this morning, Paul Courts broke into the home of Anna and Lucille Sousa at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=3050+menlo+street,+glendale,+ca&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=34.450489,59.765625&#038;layer=&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=16&#038;ll=34.193896,-118.226774&#038;spn=0.008786,0.014591&#038;om=1&#038;iwloc=addr" target="_blank">3050 Menlo Street</a>, and &quot;attempted to press his attentions&quot; on Lucille, 17.&nbsp; The girl seized a revolver and pointed it at him, at which point, Courts fled the Sousa home and was arrested for disturbing the peace.</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">150 miles away, the Deer Creek Cattlemen&#8217;s Association&#8217;s annual round-up and rodeo in <a href="http://www.ghosttowns.com/states/ca/whiteriver.htm" target="_blank">White River</a> was just another day at the fair until an unpiloted car began rolling down a steep hill towards a crowd of spectators below.&nbsp; Mrs. Burt Smith averted tragedy by jumping onto the car&#8217;s running board, steering it through several groups of children, and crashing it into the racetrack.&nbsp; Smith suffered a few bruises, the car, only a crushed radiator.</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left"><img loading="lazy" width="242" height="108" border="0" align="right" src="//farm1.static.flickr.com/220/471770670_01f6b75b2a_o.jpg" alt="burbankgirl" title="burbankgirl" />And back in the fair city of Burbank, 17-year-old Mignon Jones parachuted from a height of 2000 feet clad only in a sailor suit.&nbsp; Jones&#8217;s mother had discovered her daughter&#8217;s plan, and notified the police in the hopes of stopping her.&nbsp; However, by the time Burbank police officers arrived at the airport, Jones had already made a perfect landing and vacated the premises.&nbsp; She was later found at a local skating rink.</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">Little Mignon then faded from the pages of the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, which comes as something of a surprise.</div>
