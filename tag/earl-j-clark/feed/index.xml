Manchester Ave.</a>, the tenants were lousy and business was bad.&nbsp; But George H. Ferlin of <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=8606+hickory+st..,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=33.961159,-118.306425&#038;sspn=0.007439,0.014334&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=33.96123,-118.235142&#038;spn=0.007439,0.014334&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="hickory">8606 Hickory St.</a> had insurance and a scheme to make all his problems go up in smoke.&nbsp; One night in August 1925, Ferlin doused everything in gasoline and vacated the premises.&nbsp; Later in the evening his accomplice, 21-year-old Walter Skala, arrived on the scene, ignited the whole mess, and was burned to death for a payoff that probably amounted to a few hundred lousy dollars.</p>
<p>Was it murder?&nbsp; Some folks thought so.&nbsp; In addition to charges for arson and destroying insured property, Ferlin was charged with the murder of Walter Skala, despite the fact that he wished him no harm and was over a mile away at the time Skala sustained his injuries.&nbsp; The charge was issued under an old and little-used California statute that held a person who conspired to commit an unlawful act responsible if another person was indirectly killed as a result of that crime.</p>
<p>At Ferlin&#8217;s trial, the judge instructed the jury to deliberate only on the two lesser charges and acquit on murder.&nbsp; However, the jury ignored him roundly, saying they felt Ferlin was &quot;morally guilty&quot; in Skala&#8217;s death and convicted him of murder.&nbsp; Of course, there were appeals at the District and State level that dragged on for over two years while Ferlin sat in prison.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there was trouble at home.&nbsp; Ferlin&#8217;s wife, Jean, and her lover, Ivan Hunsacker, appeared in juvenile court on charges of contributing to the delinquency of two minors, Jean&#8217;s children.&nbsp; Apparently, since Ferlin was locked away, Hunsacker had been shacking up with Jean and the kiddies.&nbsp; The couple pled guilty to the charges.</p>
<p>In March 1927, the State Supreme Court announced that Ferlin&#8217;s appeal would be heard, along with three other notorious murder cases.&nbsp; Faithful 1947project readers will be interested to know that Earl J. Clark, aka the <a href="http://https://pensive-torvalds-020d34.netlify.app/redrosekiller" target="_blank" title="redrosekiller">Red Rose Killer</a>, was alongside Ferlin on the docket.&nbsp; Clark would hang at San Quentin later in the year, but things went better for our arsonist.</p>
<p>Today, the court ruled that Ferlin was entitled to a new trial on the murder charge since the jury had disregarded the instructions of the trial judge.&nbsp; Ferlin&#8217;s sentence of 25 years for his other convictions was upheld.&nbsp; The murder beef was eventually dismissed in 1928.</div>
