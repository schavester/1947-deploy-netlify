<div>July 22, 1927<br />Anaheim</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="234" height="142" border="0" align="right" title="costshome" alt="costshome" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1182/866397398_7a30e00083_o.gif" />Mrs. Geraldine Haster was a product of her time&mdash;too bad her time was so terribly and sinfully debased!&nbsp; It was bad enough that she had taken to wearing cosmetics (!) but <em>then</em> she had even gone so far as to bob her hair (!!)!&nbsp; Why not just tattoo &quot;SCAPEGRACE&quot; across your forehead, Geraldine?</p>
<p>When Geraldine returned with her mother and a party of friends from a motor trip to Tijuana (need we say more?) she found herself locked out of the home she shared with her husband, prominent Anaheim rancher Richard Haster.&nbsp; Geraldine filed for divorce, charging cruelty.</p>
<p>On the stand today Geraldine alleged that life with ol&rsquo; Dick was no picnic either:&nbsp; he took liberties with other women, was adverse to frequent bathing, read magazines while guests were in the house (!!!), stayed at the lodge until 4am, and, most hurtful of all, when she wore cosmetics, was told by her husband that she looked like a &ldquo;Piute Indian.&rdquo;&nbsp; She thus demands division of property valued at $100,000 ($1,102,998 USD 2006).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="273" height="126" border="0" align="left" title="lutherans!" alt="lutherans!" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1268/866392664_f3301aa397_o.gif" />Yes, the twenties were a time of tumult and turmoil as conventions unraveled, exposing lots of hypocrisy and kicked-up heels.&nbsp; Lutherans took especial offence at all this gayety, closing their thirty-fifth annual convention today with the adoption of a resolution deploring the tendency of American youth toward &ldquo;extravagance, immodesty, and disrespect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lutherans sleep easy tonight knowing that American youth turned out <em>just fine</em>.</p>
