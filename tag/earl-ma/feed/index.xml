<p>It is with great sadness that I announce that Earl Ma has died after a long battle with cancer. In addition to being a lovely guy with vast stores of energy and passion, Earl was instrumental in the <a href="https://www.savethe76ball.com/" target="_blank">campaign</a> to save his beloved 76 Balls. </p>
<p>It began with his interviewing Nathan Marsak and myself for  a feature in <em>Check the Oil!</em> magazine, but he soon became the go-to guy whenever another journalist covering the campaign needed to put Union 76 into its proper historical context. Earl knew <em>everything</em> about the brand, and was always generous responding to anyone&#8217;s questions. And in his spare time, he made an effort to videotape every 76 Ball, ideally spinning, that he could find and shared those tapes on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/profile_videos?user=theunions&#038;p=r">Youtube</a> so future generations could see lost balls <em>in situ</em>.</p>
<p>I only met Earl once, for a breakfast and Philippe&#8217;s in downtown LA with fellow 76 Ball geeks J. Eric Freedner and Nathan, but recognized him immediately in his Union 76 regalia. We all had a great visit, with no idea it would be our last. </p>

<p>I greatly appreciated Earl&#8217;s intelligence, kindness and reliability. He was a true gentleman, and it&#8217;s some small consolation to know that he left this plane knowing that the 76 Ball lives on in large part thanks to his efforts.</p>
<p>Godspeed, Earl, and thanks for all your good work and friendship.</p>
