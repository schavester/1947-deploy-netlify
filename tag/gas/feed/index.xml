<p>December 3, 1927 <br />Long Beach </p>
<p>Financial woes had driven 23 year old Clarence Martin to his breaking point. He rented a room at <a title="555 East Seaside Blvd" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=555+East+Seaside+Blvd,+Long+Beach,+CA&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=43.393645,80.595703&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">555 East Seaside Blvd.</a> in Long Beach, and resolved to end his life. </p>
<p>The young man turned on the gas and waited in the dark for the <a title="Big Sleep" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Sleep" target="_blank">Big Sleep</a>. Moments before he lost consciousness, he had a sudden change of heart and shut off the lethal fumes. Was Clarence&rsquo;s epiphany the result of a glimpse into his family&rsquo;s future without him, such as George Bailey experienced in &ldquo;<a title="wonderful life" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_a_Wonderful_Life" target="_blank">It&rsquo;s a Wonderful Life</a>&rdquo;? </p>
<p>Did Clarence breathe a sigh of relief at his escape from death and begin to make plans for the upcoming holidays? Did he think about the wife he&rsquo;d left in Gardena? She was probably worried sick because he hadn&rsquo;t come home. Maybe he was going to phone her and let her know he would be with her soon, but decided to sit and smoke a cigarette first. </p>
<p>Lighting the cigarette was Clarence&rsquo;s last act in this world. There was a terrific explosion which blew the door and windows out of the room. He was horribly burned, and later succumbed to his injuries at Seaside Hospital. </p>
