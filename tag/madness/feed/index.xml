<div>Los Angeles</div>
<div>April 30, 1907</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Sixtysomething Edward M. Robbins was a Civil War vet and long-time resident of his little house at 2728 Council Street.&nbsp; No one ever entered the threshold of his hermit home; he never spoke to his neighbors nor made sign of recognition when he passed them on the street.&nbsp; He was a quiet and at all times inoffensive man, save for those occasional spells when he would go on a colossal drunk. Then he would be seen through the uncurtained windows strumming an old guitar for a time, until he broke into mad fits of rage, pacing and singing at the top of his voice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Given his hermit-like ways, it was no wonder that Robbins&rsquo;s ten-day disappearance went unnoticed.&nbsp; But then passersby observed the multitude of flies on the windows&hellip;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Police broke in to find Robbins on a bed he&rsquo;d covered in wrapping paper. Bowie knife, razor and pair of scissors were all nearby, all besmeared with blood, as Robbins had used them all on his wrists and ankles.&nbsp; But what led to his self-destruction was a &ldquo;queerly fashioned double barreled pistol of ancient make&rdquo; that Robbins still gripped tight in his decomposing hand, one barrel having been discharged to form a gaping hole in his neck.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Perhaps Robbins suffered from the mania associated with the&nbsp; &ldquo;flashing back&rdquo; of memory common to veterans of the War of Northern Agression.</div>
</div>
