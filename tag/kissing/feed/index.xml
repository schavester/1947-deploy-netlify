<p>&nbsp;<br /><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="142" border="0" align="left" src="//static.flickr.com/104/299858560_d14e561cdc_o.gif" alt="levy's" title="levy's" />Mashers are at work across Los Angeles, although those at Levy&rsquo;s Caf&eacute; certainly don&rsquo;t have the cachet of a Caruso (or even of a Cazauran, I suspect) as reported on in Larry&rsquo;s post below.</p>
<p>This time it was the work of ruffians, an all-too infrequently used word, which we at 1947project implore our readers to use at least thrice weekly henceforth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any course, Eugene Harrison, a &ldquo;gentleman&rdquo; by occupation, of 612 Figueroa Street, had taken his friends Mr. and Mrs. George Walters of 714 Figueroa, and one Miss Margaret de Baugh, a guest at the Hotel Ohio, 1104 East Seventh, off to Levy&rsquo;s Caf&eacute; for some late-night comestibles and libations.</p>
<p>All was well until Harrison and Mr. Walters went off in search of a waiter so as to procure the group&rsquo;s nightcaps, when in strolled a couple of rowdies.&nbsp; When Harrison and Walters returned they found their lady companions engaged in a struggle for some deep lip-lock with the burly intruders.&nbsp; Walters bravely ran off to find a policeman, whereas Harrison jumped upon the brutes, and by all accounts, put up a sturdy fight.</p>
<p>When Walters returned with a constable in tow, they found a supine Harrison, having received a broken nose and two black eyes for his trouble.&nbsp; The smooch-mad barbarians had fled.</p>
<p>The Walters&rsquo;, and Harrison, recent and monied &eacute;migr&eacute;s from Pittsburgh, are anxious to have the whole sordid affair hushed, but stated they were willing to testify against the mashers if the pair were ever arrested.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The former site of Levy&#8217;s Caf&eacute; now looks like this&#8211;  <img loading="lazy" width="300" height="230" border="0" align="left" src="//static.flickr.com/102/299864544_a217a6222d_o.gif" alt="overhead" title="overhead" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8230;.could this be an Edwardian-era building, remuddled into unrecognizability?&nbsp; Well, it&rsquo;s late on a Friday night, or early on a Saturday morning, and I&rsquo;m not about to go out investigating.&nbsp; But if it is an old building, I can conjecture with certitude that its interior no longer looks like this. <img loading="lazy" width="555" height="353" border="0" align="right" src="//static.flickr.com/113/299858559_be7c0aff4a_o.jpg" alt="levysinterior" title="levysinterior" /></p>
