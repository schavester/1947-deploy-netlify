March 5, 1907<br />
Los Angeles    </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What shall we do with Emma? SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gone off to New Mexico and married a Chinaman. Her horrified mother hopes to get the marriage annulled, but Emma is an independent-minded young lady.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">EmmaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mother, Mary Culver of Monrovia, says she will do everything she can to undo her daughterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s marriage to Frank Chew, whom The Times describes as Ã¢â‚¬Å“a sort of missionary revivalist,Ã¢â‚¬Â noting that Ã¢â‚¬Å“Miss Emma had longings to help the heathen herself.Ã¢â‚¬Â</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Chew asked Culver for permission to marry Emma, but Ã¢â‚¬Å“it was bluntly refused,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times says. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Emma had a mind of her own and her answer was Ã¢â‚¬Ëœyes,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ regardless of her motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wishes.Ã¢â‚¬Â </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Even worse, Chew could be an illegal immigrant and if heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deported, Emma says she will be willing to go to China with him. She made this vow, even though she was warned that Chew would sell her into white slavery as soon as he got her to China.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Emma isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the only one in trouble. Members of the Chinese Baptist Mission are equally furious, saying that Chew borrowed jewelry from members of the congregation under the pretense of defending himself against deportation when in fact he used the money for his elopement. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In August 1907, Emma sent a letter from Hong Kong to her family, saying that their fears were baseless and that she and her husband had opened a day school where they taught English. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The next year, Emma mailed a photograph of her students and tried to recruit more women to come to China. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ã¢â‚¬Å“With her husband, Frank Chew, she has established an English school which is attended by the sons of well-to-do, educated Chinese gentlemen. The Chews have prospered beyond their wildest dreams,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times says. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ã¢â‚¬Å“Every family in Hong Kong seems anxious to have its children learn English and the pupils themselves study the language eagerly.Ã¢â‚¬Â</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Chin Man Can (or Kan) is in jail on charges of being an illegal immigrant. The young man says he is nothing of the sort, but unable to prove that he was born in San Francisco because all of his belongings were destroyed in the 1906 earthquake. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Can says that when he was 13, the rest of his family left San Francisco to return to China, but that he stayed behind, attending Chinese school and learning English. After the earthquake, he came to Los Angeles, where he was arrested while working at an Ocean Park restaurant. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Times defended Can, noting that his uncle was a wealthy San Francisco businessman, Ching Wing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ching Wing has always been so enthusiastic an American that he has arranged to bring up his baby as an American boy, forsaking the language of his fathers, wearing American clothes, reading American books. It seems like a joke that one of his relatives should be arrested,Ã¢â‚¬Â The Times says.</p>
<p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.lmharnisch.com/images/1907_0126B.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 211px; height: 358px;" src="//www.lmharnisch.com/images/1907_0126B.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal">The Times wrote in an editorial: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Every right-minded American will resent the disagreeable experiences which have befallen Chin Man Can, who appears to be our fellow countryman.<span style="">  </span>Let us hope that all will end well for him and that his heart will not become embittered because of his rough treatment. We trust he will live long and prosper in the land of his birth, which has the same regard for him that she has for all her children, of whatever race, color or creed.Ã¢â‚¬Â</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">An anonymous headline writer was not so kind, nor was a reporter who wrote: Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Ã¢â‚¬ËœMe velly flond this country,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Chin Man stated on the witness stand. Ã¢â‚¬ËœFamily all go back to China. Me hide in wood yard in Flisco till they all gone. I likee mission school, likee Ã¢â‚¬ËœMelican ways, alle slame Ã¢â‚¬ËœMelican myself.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬Â </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Although an inspector bolstered claims that Can had been smuggled into the country, testifying that he had frequently seen Can in Ensenada, a benefactor charged that the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mexican rangerÃ¢â‚¬Â was railroading Can to get the $300 bounty for turning in an illegal immigrant. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In 1913, while out on bail as his case was being appealed, Can was charged with belonging to a ring smuggling Chinese across the border. By then he was manager of the Quang Hing Lung Co. at 305 Marchessault St., and attending the University of Southern California.</p>
<p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.lmharnisch.com/images/1907_0126C.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 216px; height: 225px;" src="//www.lmharnisch.com/images/1907_0126C.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>    </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">His trial lasted into 1914 and testimony revealed that Can had adopted the names Frank Chan and W.H. Chan. He was convicted of trying to smuggle a boxcar of immigrants into the U.S. and although he appealed his case, no further information can be found in The Times.</p>

</span><span style="font-size:100%;">Immigration official A.C. Ridgway said that for some reason, most Chinese men in Los Angeles have the proper paperwork to be in the United States. </div>

<p>March 27, 1907<br /> Los Angeles&nbsp;</p>
<p>After visiting her Chinese husband in the County Jail, Mrs. Yee Lung (also called Mrs. Frank Chew) spoke of her intention to join her beloved as he was deported, and to travel with him in the train car packed with forty other Chinese deportees for the trip up to San Francisco. </p>
<p>Special permission has been granted by the U.S. Marshall for her to ride with her husband. They will immediately board a boat to Hong Kong, and the woman may never again see her white friends relatives in this country.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lung&#8217;s friends have pleaded with her to reconsider, but she insists &quot;I trust my husband implicitly&#8230; he wouldn&#8217;t go without me, and I wouldn&#8217;t be so cruel as to ask him to.&quot; </p>
