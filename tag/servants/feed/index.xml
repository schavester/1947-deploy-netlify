<p>December 2, 1927<br />Hollywood</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="266" height="278" border="0" align="left" title="theclimax" alt="theclimax" src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2293/2079400572_ed608e7741_o.jpg" />Mrs. Margaret Pumphrey, 27, of the <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=6727+Milner+Rd,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90068&#038;sll=34.109406,-118.334684&#038;sspn=0.008226,0.013154&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.108571,-118.334679&#038;spn=0.001028,0.001644&#038;z=19&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="6727MilnerRd">Milner Road</a> Pumphreys, was standing in her bedroom of her hillside home, preparing to go downtown, when she was approached by her white-jacketed butler.&nbsp; He asked if there were any further orders.&nbsp; Mrs. Pumphrey said there were none.</p>
<p>With that, her servant&mdash;Richard R. Ewell, 30&mdash;developed an &ldquo;insane gleam&rdquo; in his eye and approached further&hellip;whereupon Mrs. Pumphrey noticed the .45 automatic in his hand. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The chase&mdash;and fusillade of shots&mdash;began!&nbsp; Mrs. Pumphey fled through a bathroom and into an adjoining bedroom, through a hallway and down the stairs, but there&rsquo;s no running from the staff.&nbsp; They know the house better than you do.</p>
<p>The mad pursuit and firearm blasts continued from room to room to room until Margaret managed to lock herself into a downstairs bedroom.&nbsp; Ewell fired several shots into the door to break the lock, but once he heard the window open, he ran around the house to catch her escaping.&nbsp; And catch her he did&mdash;as he climbed into the window, he shot her in the side as she ran screaming out the door. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The screams alarmed neighbor Mrs. Johnstone, who came running (with her two maids in tow [also suitably armed?]) and Ewell fired upon them from the home&rsquo;s entryway&mdash;but Ewell, realizing that the alarm had been raised and his game discovered, put the barrel to his head and sent his brains all over the foyer he&rsquo;d kept so spotless the three months he&rsquo;d been under the Pumphrey&rsquo;s employ.</p>
<p>Mrs. Margaret Pumphrey (could Kaufman &amp; Ryskind have scripted a name of greater puffery?) suffered more from shock and fright (as visions of <a href="https://1947project.com/?p=2088" target="_blank" title="wrightwatch27">FLW</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pbs.org/flw/buildings/taliesin/taliesin_wright02.html" target="_blank" title="juliancarlton">former servant</a> surely flashed through her head) than from her injury; she was rushed to <a href="https://jpg3.lapl.org/pics32/00065893.jpg" target="_blank" title="HolRec">Hollywood Receiving</a> and was treated for the superficial wound and released. &nbsp;</p>
<p>According to LeRoy Bird, with whom Ewell lived at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=4307+Hooper+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90011&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=63.215425,107.753906&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.006566,-118.252158&#038;spn=0.008236,0.013154&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="EwellsPlace">4307 Hooper Avenue</a>, Philadelphia native Ewell was an industrious man of good character and habits and never had any previous trouble.&nbsp; Detective Lieutenant Mahoney contends that Ewell had probably been crazed by dope, especially as he&rsquo;d been out the night before and had acted strangely in the morning.</p>
<p>Ewell leaves a widow, Inez Ewell, in Kansas City.&nbsp; Because his death was self-inflicted, there was no inquest over the body.&nbsp; A small notebook was later found in Ewell&rsquo;s possessions, and it was greatly hoped by Captain of Detectives Slaughter to contain names of prominent Hollywood people and information about dope trafficking; but sadly for Slaughter, &ldquo;the only names in the book, the officer declares, are those of negresses and it is devoid of anything referring to narcotics or trade in the drugs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So why did Richard Ewell snap?&nbsp; If only we had some <a href="https://www.butlersandsigns.com/nebu6lisist.html" target="_blank" title="pumphreysdecoratingtastes">sign</a>.</p>
