Los Angeles</p>
<p>&#8220;I love him, judge, and I just can&#8217;t keep away from him,&#8221; said winsome Grace Evans as tears coursed down her cheek.  But she promised Justice Austin never to go near him again.  </p>
<p>She was a simple country girl, caught in the swirl of gay city life, when she was led into a career of sin by one Alfred Medina.  He taught her innocent twenty year-old mouth the ways of wrapping around an opium pipe.  She stole twenty-three dollars to feed her habit, was popped for grand larceny, and spent a week in jail before being hauled before Austin.  It was the contention of Deputy District Attorney Pearson that she had been more sinned against that had sinned, urging that she should escape sentence if she returned to the country to begin life anew.</p>
<p>And so it came to be that she promised never to see Medina again.  But a young girl in the throes of having her innocence destroyed can scarcely be believed, though in time perhaps she may be redeemed.</p>
<p>In other Court news, Jesus &#8220;Bar Wielder&#8221; Suega was convicted of disturbing the peace and sentenced to twenty-five days in the City Jail.  Suega had run amok in the Llewellyn Iron Works earlier in the week, attacking the workmen with a heavy piece of iron and driving all employees en masse from the establishment.</p>
