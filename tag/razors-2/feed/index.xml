<p>Kids are running amok in 1927 Los Angeles, setting fires, eating razors, crawling under fumigation tents and stealing babies from their mothers. And the adults aren&#8217;t behaving much better, what with the married guys conning nice working girls into bigamistic unions and the guy what found the fountain of youth and knows where the Czar&#8217;s fortune is banked, and all he needs from you is $25,000 and a nice spot to rub his mystic peapod paste.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s our own Crimebo the Crime Clown, and he is in a funk. There are so many things he hates about Halloween, can he count the ways? You bet!</p>
<p>Tune in to hear about how Peter Pan tried to kick Crimebo&#8217;s ass at the Chinese Theater, how the apocalypse is coming with a rain of cheese and Nathan&#8217;s love letter to crude oil. It&#8217;s all here on the 1947project Podcast, featuring Crimebo, Kim Cooper, Nathan Marsak, Mary McCoy and Joan Renner.</p>
<p>So give it a listen, won&#8217;t you?</p>

<p><a href="/?p=2128" target="_blank" title="VMPike">Last week </a>we told you of the extrahuman feats of two and one-half year-old Virginia Mae Pike.&nbsp; And now, collector of tale of childhood freakdom, comes two and one-half year-old Jimmy Baker Bogart.</p>
<p>The Pikes were fond of fumigators; the <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=960+E+Dryden+St,+Glendale,+CA+91207&#038;sll=34.161286,-118.242846&#038;sspn=0.0087,0.014591&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.161081,-118.242835&#038;spn=0.00435,0.007296&#038;z=17&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="bogarts">Bogarts</a>, rusty razors.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d leave them lying around until they&rsquo;d accumulate sufficient rust to look tasty enough, one supposes.&nbsp; In any event, just such a brown&rsquo;d blade seemed worth experimenting on with a new set of teeth, so li&rsquo;l Jimmy bit off a chunk of Gillette. Though Mrs. Bogart pulled the major portion of our erstwhile whisker remover from Jimmy&rsquo;s mouth, she watched a good piece of it go south.&nbsp; The hastily summoned physician, apparently seeking to avoid the imperative and serious operation, put JB on an oatmeal and potato diet and that was that; the razor remain was satisfactorily dissolved within.</p>
<p>One wonders if li&rsquo;l Jimmy grew up to develop a pathological aversion to the &ldquo;safety&rdquo; device, or if, conversely, having developed a taste and his inclination, went on to ingest the objects for a <a href="https://www.jimrosecircus.com/newest_site/flash/main.html" target="_blank" title="flashforward">living</a>.</p>
