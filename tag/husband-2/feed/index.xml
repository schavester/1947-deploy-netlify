<p>Seems a traveling sewing machine salesman dropped by Mrs. L.K. Sitton&#8217;s home at 1004 Electric Avenue and, when she complained of a slight headache, mentioned that he was an expert in Swedish massage and offered to relieve her. </p>
<p>The Times reported that &quot;He fled&#8230; when his victim screamed and her husband returned unexpectedly.&quot; Though we wonder if perhaps things didn&#8217;t happen <em>quite</em> in that order.</p>
<p>In any event, Robert S. Harrell, 41, was arrested at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&#038;hl=en&#038;saddr=1004+electric+avenue,+venice,+ca&#038;daddr=sixth+and+san+juan,+venice,+ca&#038;sll=33.994167,-118.471606&#038;sspn=0.007241,0.012381&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=17&#038;om=1" target="_blank">San Juan and Sixth Avenue</a> on charges of attempting an attack on the lady. </p>

<p>March 30, 1907<br /> Los Angeles&nbsp;</p>
<p>Newlyweds Mr. and Mrs. Paul Solf, a couple from Denver who have been honeymooning at the Estelle at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=312+W+1st+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90012&#038;ll=34.055255,-118.245807&#038;spn=0.013618,0.037122" target="_blank">312 1/2 West First Street</a>, paid a visit to the police this evening at the insistence of the lady.  </p>
<p>Paul Solf told the desk sergeant that he had returned to their room earlier, to find his wife reading a letter from a former admirer. As he snatched it away, a photograph fell out, and the pair commenced to arguing. After a time, Mrs. Solf said that if he did not accompany her to the police station, she would call for them herself. Thinking she was bluffing, he joined her in a perambulation towards Central Station.</p>
<p> Upon entering, Mrs. Solf declared that Paul Solf had threatened her with a revolver. He denied this, but a quick search revealed a heavy revolver on his person. Solf was locked up, while officers determined that he had a letter for $5000 credit from a Denver bank, and nearly as much in cash. On reflection, Mrs. Solf decided she didn&#8217;t wish to prosecute, but officers still plan to charge him for carrying a concealed weapon.</p>
<p>Solf is a race horse man, and his bride a bit of a gambler.&nbsp;</p>
