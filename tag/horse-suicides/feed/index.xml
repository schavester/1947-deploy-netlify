Los Angeles<span style="font-size: 100%;">In a jailhouse interview before he was taken to San Quentin, <a href="https://1947project.com/fleenor-recaptured">James G. Fleenor</a></span><span style="font-size: 100%;">, the barefoot burglar, set the record straight on his escapes, his relationship with a white woman and how he began a life of crime.<br />
</span><span style="font-size: 100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size: 100%;">It had been rumored that Fleenor returned to Los Angeles after escaping from a San Francisco jail because of his relationship with Mrs. B.J. Byres of 1669 Tennessee St. He insisted that he hopped the first freight train leaving the yard and discovered later that it was going to Los Angeles.<br />
</span><span style="font-size: 100%;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size: 100%;">Fleenor, who used a real estate business as a front for his burglaries, said that she was one of only three customers who continued paying on her property after he was sent to jail. </span></p>
