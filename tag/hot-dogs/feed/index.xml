<p>October 23, 1927<br />Los Angeles  </p>
<p>John A. Horn was born to be a poet but Fate (O! cruel mistress she!) decreed he make his living as a lingerie salesman. Worse, he was married to a woman who did not understand the lyricism of his delicate artist&#8217;s soul. So he left his wife&mdash;but not before explaining himself in verse.   </p>
<p>Martha Horn, seeking a divorce upon the grounds of desertion, recently handed her errant husband&#8217;s scribbled magnum opus to Judge Gates:    </p>
<p><em>&quot;I&#8217;ll wait here &#8217;till the sun sets,&quot; I told her<br />&quot;If you are hungry, there&#8217;s a stand upon the pier.&quot;<br />She nodded. &quot;You can wait. I won&#8217;t be long.&quot;<br />And saying this, she left me with the sun.<br />I sat upon the sand and watched the gulls<br />Skimming the restless water striped with gold.<br />The rolling waves tossed foam upon the beach;<br />&quot;The lacy underthings the Old World wears,&quot;<br />I told myself, then smiled quite satisfied:<br />Not many a clerk in a department store<br />From seven to six could say such clever things.<br />. . . . the sun<br />Was almost gone, the rounded golden edge<br />Was sinking out of sight when my wife called<br />&quot;John.&quot; I saw her coming down the beach<br />Munching a bun. &quot;I&#8217;ve one for you,&quot; she said.<br />I turned. The sun had sunk into the sea.</em>  </p>
<p>&quot;And when I gave him the hot dog, he got sore,&quot; Mrs. Horn clarified for the court.   </p>
<p>&quot;This is just another example of the ancient controversy between rhyme and reason,&quot; chortled Judge Gates before granting a divorce to the long-suffering Mrs. Horn.   </p>
