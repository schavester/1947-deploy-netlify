<div>
<div align="left"><img loading="lazy" width="210" height="240" border="0" align="left" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1401/1405743722_b4a7079128_m.jpg" alt="vonfalkenstein1" title="vonfalkenstein1" />Let us now turn our attention to the male weaverbird, who craft intricate nests to attract a female by stitching and knotting grasses together.&nbsp; Less industrious and ethical is our friend, the starling, who will sometimes steal the nest of another bird for mating.</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">And then, there&#8217;s one Fred W. Von Falkenstein, an insurance broker formerly of Butte, Montana, who put the starlings to shame by stealing over $60,000 worth of home furnishings for his Alhambra love nest.&nbsp; Von Falkenstein was betrothed to a Miss Anne Marshall, also of Butte, who was soon to come to Alhambra so they could be wed.&nbsp; However, it was not to be.</p>
<p>Von Falkenstein was apprehended after he came to have a peek at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=223+s.+mccadden+pl.,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=29.440076,59.765625&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.071715,-118.337195&#038;spn=0.007501,0.014591&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="mccaddenpl">223 S. McCadden Place</a>, a home that had recently gone on the market.&nbsp; There, he met real estate salesman H.H. Morgan, who did not get Fred&#8217;s name, but found him suspicious enough to jot down his license plate number as he drove away.&nbsp; When the house was later burgled, Morgan <img loading="lazy" width="137" height="240" border="0" align="right" src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1416/1405743772_d2a49b61cb_m.jpg" alt="vonfalkenstein2" title="vonfalkenstein2" />handed the number over to police who confiscated between 6 and 8 carloads of stolen goods from Von Falkenstein&#8217;s home at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=619+meridian+ave.,+alhambra,+ca&#038;sll=34.071715,-118.337195&#038;sspn=0.007501,0.014591&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.088582,-118.15414&#038;spn=0.007499,0.014591&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="meridian">619 Meridian Avenue</a>.&nbsp; Found among the items were Oriental rugs, solid silver home accessories, a radio cabinet, and a French salon painting valued at approximately $5000 that he&#8217;d lifted from the art gallery at the <a href="https://jpg1.lapl.org/spnb01/00007150.jpg" target="_blank" title="ambassadorhotel">Ambassador Hotel</a>.</p>
<p>Though Von Falkenstein worked with an accomplice, Robert Donaldson of <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=1928+crenshaw,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=34.088582,-118.15414&#038;sspn=0.007499,0.014591&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.040783,-118.331165&#038;spn=0.007503,0.014591&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank" title="crenshaw">1928 Crenshaw</a>, he acted alone in the art theft and said it was easy.&nbsp; He simply walked into the empty gallery, cut the canvas out of its frame, rolled it up, and walked out of the Ambassador without drawing any attention.</p>
<p>In addition to the art theft, Von Falkenstein also pled guilty to two more home burglaries, and was sentenced to 2 terms of 1 to 15 years at San Quentin.&nbsp; And so it was that our love bird turned jailbird.</p></div>
