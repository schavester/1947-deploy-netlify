<p>The news of the day is not especially happy. Film director <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0903049/" target="_blank">Josef Von Sternberg&#8217;</a>s marriage to assistant director/actress <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0747324/" target="_blank">Riza Royce</a> has ended after a year following an disagreement over Miss Royce&#8217;s determination to have a nose job. Miss Royce had her nose straightened and collected cash and a car, while Mr. Von Sternberg kept their <a href="http://www.zillow.com/HomeDetails.htm?zprop=20776175" target="_blank">home</a> at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=6252+Drexel,+los+angeles,+ca&#038;sll=34.04458,-118.24896&#038;sspn=0.006863,0.012681&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.069743,-118.363008&#038;spn=0.006861,0.012681&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">6252 Drexel</a>.</p>
<p>The first anniversary of the death of screen sheik Rudolph Valentino was occasion for a Catholic mass at the Church of the Blessed Sacrament attended by family and a few friends and fans, in stark contrast to the mob scenes that accompanied his burial. Following the service, the worshippers visited <a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&#038;GRid=1053" target="_blank">Valentino&#8217;s crypt</a> in the Hollywood Mausoleum and strewed flowers around the aisles.</p>
<p>And down at a flophouse at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=1104+South+Main+Street,+Los+Angeles,+CA&#038;sll=34.04458,-118.24896&#038;sspn=0.006863,0.012681&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=34.041761,-118.255055&#038;spn=0.006863,0.012681&#038;z=16&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1" target="_blank">1104 South Main Street</a>, after a day&#8217;s posting, the sign on a door warning the residents not to disturb the baby became an object of curiosity, and the door was opened. Inside, a tiny redheaded boy babe of perhaps 14 months, quite dead, with cotton stuffed in his mouth and nostrils, a bloody nightgown and signs of strangulation on the child&#8217;s neck. Police have taken fingerprints from the room and handwriting samples from the note and hotel register, and are searching for a Mrs. W. Howard of Los Angeles. The nameless infant now rests in the County Morgue.</div>
