Vernon Junior High, saying, &quot;I spoke with Mrs Holt, and am satisfied that I would have acted as she did if I were confronted with the same circumstances.&quot;</p>
<p>Holt excused Marion Parker from school on Thursday, December 15 when a slender man came to the desk and asked for &quot;P.M. Parker&#8217;s youngest daughter,&quot; saying that her father had been in an automobile accident.&nbsp; Holt hesitated, knowing that Marion was a twin.&nbsp; However, the man persisted, saying, &quot;I am an employee at the bank where Mr. Parker is chief clerk, and if there is any doubt in your mind, here is the bank&#8217;s telephone number.&nbsp; You may call there.&quot;</p>
<p>Convinced, Holt sent an office assistant to get Marian from class.&nbsp; &quot;Marion was nervous and excited when I told her that her father had been injured.&nbsp; The news completely broke up a little Christmas party the children were having in their room, and Marion had some of the refreshments in her hands when she came into the room.&nbsp; But at once she forgot about everything but her father.&quot;</p>
<p>Marion was excused from school, and left with the man who would, three days later, end her life.</p>
<p>After the kidnapping, Holt said, &quot;Oh, I can think of many things I could have done now.&nbsp; I never would have let Marion go but for the apparent sincerity and disarming manner of the man.&quot;</p>
<p>Private funeral services for 12-year-old Marion Parker were held today at the Little Church of Flowers at Forest Lawn Cemetery, after which her body was cremated.&nbsp; The search for her killer continues, with police and citizens as far away as Denver and Portland on the lookout for the Fox.</p></div>
